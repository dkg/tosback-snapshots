                <p>We, KitApps, Inc. dba Attendify (“Attendify”), provide various event management software solutions to event organizers (each, a “Client”) for use in connection with one or more in-person or virtual events (each, an “Event”). These solutions include mobile applications, websites, attendee data management tools and other event-related products (collectively, the “Products”). Our Clients may, in turn, make some of these Products available to their customers for the purpose of attending and participating in their Events (“End Users”). We also offer certain support and hosting services related to the Products, as well as the Attendify website currently located at <a href="/" target="_blank">www.attendify.com</a> and all subdomains therein (the “Site” and, together with the Products and related support and hosting services, the “Services”).</p>

                  These Terms apply to your use of the Services if you are accessing the Services as a Client or on behalf of a Client to create and manage one or more Events (together with the Client, “you” or “your”).

                <p>
                  To the extent that, in connection with your use of the Services, you access, store, or otherwise process any personal information of End Users, you agree to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, rules, orders, and ordinances with respect to such information including, but not limited to, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (2016/EC/679) (the “GDPR”), the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), and the CAN-SPAM ACT.

                  In furtherance, and not by limitation of, the foregoing, if we share information with you about End Users residing in the European Union or Switzerland, you represent and warrant that: (i) you will provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles (the “Principles”) with respect to such information; (ii) you will take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that you effectively process the personal information transferred in a manner consistent with the Principles; (iii) you will notify us if you makes a determination that you can no longer meet your obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Principles; (iv) upon notice, including under (iii), we may take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing; and (v) we may provide a summary or a representative copy of the relevant privacy provisions of this Agreement to the U.S. Department of Commerce upon request.

                <h4>Payment and Refund Terms</h4>
                <ol class="privacy__sub-list">
                  <li>
                    <p><b>Generally.</b> We offer various products as part of our Services. The following provisions shall apply to your use of the Services generally. If you use one of the special products listed in Sections 5(b) or 5(c), certain additional terms listed in those Sections will apply to your use of the Services. </p>
                    <ol class="privacy__sub-list">
                      <li><p><span class="underline">Fees for the Services.</span> Unless Client and Attendify agree otherwise in writing, Client agrees to pay the fees for the Services as specified in this Agreement and on the Site (the “Fees”). Generally, the Fees will consist either of a one-time charge for “a-la-carte” services or an annual subscription for a package. Unless otherwise noted, all annual subscriptions provide a license to the Services for one (1) Event, and additional subscription(s) need to be purchase for any additional Events. The Fees are subject to change from time to time upon 30 days’ notice, which notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the Site or otherwise communicated to you in writing. Your continued use of the Services after the effective date of such change will constitute your agreement to pay the updated Fees.</p></li>
                      <li><p><span class="underline">Subscription Packages.</span> If you purchase an annual subscription package, to the extent that you don’t use all of the benefits of the subscription package (such as ticket or registration credits) in a given year, you will not be entitled to a prorated refund of the Fees paid, and such benefits will not rollover to a subsequent year.</p></li>
                      <li><p><span class="underline">Free Trial.</span> We may offer you a free trial that gives you access to certain features of the Services. You acknowledge that publishing a mobile application developed using our Services (an “App”) requires a paid account, and that we may terminate any free trial in our absolute discretion at any time.</p></li>
                      <li><p><span class="underline">Payments.</span> You must pay all Fees either in advance (for example, on an annual subscription) or upon the submission of an invoice to you, as agreed by you and Attendify. If we agree to invoice you for the Services, payment is due upon receipt of each invoice. All payments made through the Site must be made via a valid credit card. If we agree to invoice you for the Services, payment must be made as specified on the invoice.</p></li>
                      <li><p><span class="underline">Late Fees.</span> In the event that you fail to pay to Attendify any Fees more than thirty (30) days after they become due, such Fees will bear interest calculated from the date due until paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser of (A) one percent (1%) per month, compounded monthly, and (B) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.</p></li>
                      <li><p><span class="underline">Refunds of Fees.</span> Unless Client and Attendify agree otherwise in writing, there will be no refunds or credits of any Fees paid by you for any reason, including, without limitation, for setup fees, partial month or year of service (in the case of a prepaid annual subscription package), upgrade/downgrade refunds, refunds for months unused or rejection of an App by a Provider (as defined below). </p></li>
                      <li><p><span class="underline">Taxes.</span> All Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties, excluding only United States (federal or state) taxes on Attendify income.</p></li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><b>Lead Retrieval Product.</b> If you sign up for our Lead Retrieval product, we offer a revenue sharing option in which we will bill and collect payment from exhibitors or sponsors at your Event and remit a percentage of such proceeds to you (the “Lead Retrieval Share”). The Lead Retrieval Share is subject to change from time to time, and the most up-to-date Lead Retrieval Share will be posted on the Site. We will pay you the Lead Retrieval Share within seven (7) days of the end of your Event. Payments will only be made through PayPal® and only after we have received the applicable tax forms from you that may be requested by us.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><b>Event and Session Registration Products.</b> If you sign up for our Event Registration and/or Session Registration products, whether as a standalone “a-la-carte” Product or as part of a subscription package, the following terms will apply:</p>
                    <ol class="privacy__sub-list">
                      <li><p>You may have the option to charge a fee for registrations and tickets to an Event or an Event session (a “Session”). All proceeds, including, without limitation, ticket face value, Attendify’s Fees, taxes, and royalties, from such sales (collectively, "Sale Proceeds") will be collected by our third-party payment processing partners, such as Stripe® (the “Payment Processing Partners”). You hereby consent to such collection. Our Payment Processing Partners will transfer to you, within such time period that is consistent with their practices, the Sale Proceeds for such event less Attendify’s Fees (if applicable), the applicable fees charged by the Payment Processing Partner, refunds, disputed charges, chargebacks and any other applicable fees and deductions.
                      </p></li>
                      <li><p>If you select our “a-la-carte” pricing model, we will charge a Fee based on the number of registrations or tickets offered plus a percentage of the Sale Proceeds from such Event(s). Such Fees will be calculated based upon the face value of each registration or ticket (not taking into account any fees charged by the Payment Processing Partner), and you hereby agree to have our Payment Processing Partners directly remit such Fees to us.</p></li>
                      <li><p>Alternatively, you may choose our subscription package model, in which case you will be entitled to a certain number of tickets or registration credits, which are non-transferable and any unused tickets or credits will not be refunded to you or rolled over to a subsequent year. Any Fees for a subscription package will be invoiced to you, and the invoice will be due and payable upon receipt. Please note that paid tickets or registrations to Sessions are only provided as part of a subscription package, and not our “a-la-carte” Products.</p></li>
                      <li><p>The collection of Sale Proceeds shall be subject to and governed by the terms of such Payment Processing Partners, and Attendify assumes no responsibility and shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of Payment Processing Partners. You may be required by the Payment Processing Partners to enter into an agreement directly with such Payment Processing Partners.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li><p>Except for a ticket that has been refunded pursuant to clause (v) below, you agree to accept, honor and fulfill all tickets, whether free or paid, that have been confirmed by Attendify through the Services. It is your sole responsibility to confirm the authenticity of any ticket and to confirm that any attendee has acquired a valid ticket.</p></li>
                      <li><p>When posting an Event, you must communicate a refund policy for the Event and the Sessions, if applicable. If you choose to offer refunds to any Event or Session attendees, you authorize our Payment Processing Partners to issue on your behalf a refund of the Sale Proceeds (less any fees charged by the Payment Processing Partner). All disputes with respect to ticket refunds are to be handled between Client and the attendees of the Event and/or Session.</p></li>
                      <li><p>You may not post, through the Services, any Events (including any Sessions) which: (A) violate or facilitate the violation of any applicable law, (B) would be prohibited under the rules and regulations of the Card Schemes and Alternative Form of Payment Frameworks, (C) take place in a country to which the United States has embargoed goods and/or services of the same type as the Services, and (D) contain any User Content that would violate these Terms or our Acceptable Use Policy below. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a posted Event violates the previous sentence, we reserve the right to cancel the Event, to suspend or terminate your account and access to the Services and/or to report you to applicable law enforcement agencies for further action.</p></li>
                      <li>
                        <p>
                          You agree that it is your sole responsibility to determine, collect, report and remit any taxes (including, without limitation, sales, use and value-added tax) that may must be collected in connection with your use of the Services.
                        </p>

                <h4>Responsibility for User Content (DMCA Policy)</h4>
                <p>We respect the rights of third-party creators and content owners and expect that you will do the same. Given the nature of the Services and the volume of information submitted, we cannot and do not monitor all messages, data, information, text, graphics, audio, video or other materials and content of any kind posted/uploaded/transmitted to or through the Services by our users (collectively, “User Content”, and any such User Content posted to or through your Attendify account, “Your Content”). You expressly agree that we: (a) will not be liable for any User Content and (b) reserve the right to review, reject, delete, remove, modify, or edit any User Content at any time for any reason, without liability and without notice to you. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to remove User Content from the Services for any reason, including any of Your Content that we believe violates these Terms or our Acceptable Use Policy below.</p>
                <p>It is our policy to respond to all claims of intellectual property infringement. We will promptly investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions required under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2) ("DMCA") and other applicable intellectual property laws.</p>

                <ol class="privacy__sub-list">
                  <li>
                    <p><b>Publishing the Apps</b> - You have two options with respect to publishing an App. First, you may choose to publish an App through Attendify’s registered developer account with one or more mobile platform providers (collectively, “Providers”), including, but not limited to, the Apple Inc. (“Apple”) App Store™ and Google Play™. If you choose to have the App published through Attendify’s developer account, Attendify will be the sole publisher of the App and the App will appear as an Attendify application with each Provider. Second, you may choose to self-publish an App with a Provider using your own developer account. You acknowledge that if you choose to self-publish an App, additional fees may apply. Attendify will use commercially reasonable efforts to have your App(s) approved by the applicable Providers. However, we do not and cannot guarantee acceptance by a Provider, and therefore assume no responsibility for rejection of any App by a Provider. If your App is denied by a Provider, you will be notified. However, you will not be provided any refund of any Fees paid by you under any circumstances.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><b>Accessing the Apps</b> - Our Apps are generally accessible via a mobile device that is compatible with our mobile service. We do not warrant that any App will be compatible with all mobile devices. We grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of each App for one account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your sole use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the App, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute, transfer or otherwise make available the App to any third party or use the App to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the App; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the App, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the App, or features that enforce limitations on use of the App; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the App. You acknowledge that we may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the App, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the App that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of these Terms will apply to all such upgrades. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the App or any copy thereof, and we or our third party licensors or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in and to the App and any copy or portion of the App. You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the App and the Services. Standard carrier data charges may apply to your use of the App.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p><b>Apps from iTunes</b> - The following also applies to any App you acquire from us from the iTunes Store (“iTunes-Sourced Software”): You acknowledge and agree that these Terms are solely between you and us, not Apple, and that Apple has no responsibility for the iTunes-Sourced Software or content thereof. Your use of the iTunes-Sourced Software must comply with the Apple App Store Terms. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the iTunes-Sourced Software.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p><b>Apple Developer Account</b> - In the event that you need to share access to your Apple developer account with Attendify for any reason, and if there is more than one app in such developer account, then Attendify agrees that it shall: (i) not access any app other than an Attendify-powered app in the developer account; (ii) not modify or alter any non-Attendify-powered app or the code with respect thereto; (iii) only use the access to your developer account to submit, manage and update Attendify-powered apps; and (iv) agrees to maintain as your confidential information any information related to non-Attendify-powered apps which it may inadvertently discover.</p>

Our Clients may, in turn, make some of these Products available to their customers for the purpose of attending and participating in their Events (“End Users”). We also offer certain support and hosting services related to the Products, as well as the Attendify website currently located at <a href="/" target="_blank">www.attendify.com</a> and all subdomains therein (the “Site” and, together with the Products and related support and hosting services, the “Services”).

                <p>If you use the Services in connection with an Event Registration and/or Session Registration product purchased by a Client, the following terms shall apply to your use of the Services:</p>
                <ol class="privacy__sub-list">
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      You may be requested by the Client posting the Event and/or an Event session (a “Session”) to show a valid ticket or confirmation of a valid ticket or confirmed registration prior to entry into the Event or Session. You may not present a cancelled, refunded, duplicate or counterfeit ticket or confirmation, or otherwise take any other fraudulent act with respect to attending an Event or Session.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      All proceeds (including, without limitation, face value of a ticket or confirmation, Attendify’s Fees, taxes, and royalties) from the sale of paid tickets or confirmed registrations via the Services (collectively, "Sale Proceeds") will be collected by our third-party payment processing partners, such as Stripe® (the “Payment Processing Partners”). The collection of Sale Proceeds shall be subject to and governed by the terms of the Payment Processing Partners, and Attendify assumes no responsibility and shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of Payment Processing Partners. We encourage you to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the Payment Processing Partners.

                    <p>
                      Each Event is generally required to post a refund policy on the Event page, which policy is determined solely by the Client. You acknowledge and agree that all disputes with respect to refunds of tickets or confirmed registration are to be handled solely between you and the Client, and Attendify will not assume any role or responsibility with respect to any refunds.
