Generally, the Fees will consist either of a one-time charge for “a-la-carte” services or an annual subscription for a package. Unless otherwise noted, all annual subscriptions provide a license to the Services for one (1) Event, and additional subscription(s) need to be purchase for any additional Events. The Fees are subject to change from time to time upon 30 days’ notice, which notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the Site or otherwise communicated to you in writing.

Mobile Apps</h3><ul role="list" class="in-text-list"><li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text paragraph">Publishing the Apps</strong> - You have two options with respect to publishing an App. First, you may choose to publish an App through Attendify’s registered developer account with one or more mobile platform providers (collectively, “Providers”), including, but not limited to, the Apple Inc. (“Apple”) App Store™ and Google Play™. If you choose to have the App published through Attendify’s developer account, Attendify will be the sole publisher of the App and the App will appear as an Attendify application with each Provider. Second, you may choose to self-publish an App with a Provider using your own developer account. You acknowledge that if you choose to self-publish an App, additional fees may apply. Attendify will use commercially reasonable efforts to have your App(s) approved by the applicable Providers. However, we do not and cannot guarantee acceptance by a Provider, and therefore assume no responsibility for rejection of any App by a Provider. If your App is denied by a Provider, you will be notified. However, you will not be provided any refund of any Fees paid by you under any circumstances.</li><li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text paragraph">Accessing the Apps</strong> -  Our Apps are generally accessible via a mobile device that is compatible with our mobile service. We do not warrant that any App will be compatible with all mobile devices. We grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of each App for one account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your sole use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the App, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute, transfer or otherwise make available the App to any third party or use the App to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the App; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the App, features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content accessible through the App, or features that enforce limitations on use of the App; or (v) delete the copyright and other proprietary rights notices on the App. You acknowledge that we may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the App, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the App that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of these Terms will apply to all such upgrades. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the App or any copy thereof, and we or our third party licensors or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in and to the App and any copy or portion of the App. You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the App and the Services. Standard carrier data charges may apply to your use of the App.</li><li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text paragraph">Apps from iTunes</strong> - The following also applies to any App you acquire from us from the iTunes Store (“iTunes-Sourced Software”): You acknowledge and agree that these Terms are solely between you and us, not Apple, and that Apple has no responsibility for the iTunes-Sourced Software or content thereof. Your use of the iTunes-Sourced Software must comply with the Apple App Store Terms. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the iTunes-Sourced Software.<br></li><li class="list-item"><strong class="bold-text paragraph">Apple Developer Account</strong> - In the event that you need to share access to your Apple developer account with Attendify for any reason, and if there is more than one app in such developer account, then Attendify agrees that it shall: (i) not access any app other than an Attendify-powered app in the developer account; (ii) not modify or alter any non-Attendify-powered app or the code with respect thereto; (iii) only use the access to your developer account to submit, manage and update Attendify-powered apps; and (iv) agrees to maintain as your confidential information any information related to non-Attendify-powered apps which it may inadvertently discover.<br></li></ul></div><div class="link-to-text-container"><h3>11.
