<h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

	Last Updated 25 May 2018
</p>
<h3>	Policy Summary</h3>
<p>
	In order to provide you with goods and services and protect ourselves and others from malicious activity, DesignCrowd collects personal data from the users of its sites. This information includes information our users give to us, information we collect as you use our sites as well as some information that is supplemented from third parties.
	DesignCrowd has implemented a number of measures to ensure your personal data remains safe when stored by us and when being transferred.
	You may access your personal data, request a change or correction or request your data be deleted by contacting us via the channels described below. All requests will be facilitated to the amount reasonable and possible without breaching our data retention obligations.

<h3>1   Introduction</h3>
<p>
	DesignCrowd Pty Ltd ACN 127 272 315, and its related entities and brands, including BrandCrowd, ("DesignCrowd", "we", "us", "our") takes your privacy seriously. We are subject to the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and will protect your personal data in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles ("APPs"). The APPs govern how we collect and otherwise handle your personal data. There are also international standards relating to personal data processing and use, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to which DesignCrowd adheres.
	Where DesignCrowd is referenced either by name or by "we", "us", "our" in this policy it is intended to be inclusive of both DesignCrowd and BrandCrowd.
	This Privacy Policy explains in general terms how we protect the privacy of your personal data and applies to any personal data that we collect from, or about, you. It should be read along with all other DesignCrowd terms of services found <a href="https://www.designcrowd.com/user-agreement" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
<h3>2   The Information We Collect and Hold</h3>
<p>
	Personal data is any information that could directly or indirectly identify you. Under the GDPR, &lsquo;personal data&rsquo; means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&lsquo;data subject&rsquo;); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
<h4>	Information you provide</h4>
<p>
	You may provide us with personal data when you:
</p>
<ul>
	<li style="list-style-type:none;">(a) create an account with DesignCrowd; or</li>
	<li style="list-style-type:none;">(b) edit or add to personal data attached to your account details after your account has been created; or</li>
	<li style="list-style-type:none;">(c) indirectly create an account with DesignCrowd via one our partners; or</li>
	<li style="list-style-type:none;">(d) request or purchase goods or services from us; or</li>
	<li style="list-style-type:none;">(e) contact us by any method, such as telephone, email, post, facsimile or in person; or</li>
	<li style="list-style-type:none;">(f) correspond via our site, either with one of our staff or with another site user</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Personal data you provide that we store may include, but not be limited to; your email address, your name, your country, your address, other contact details, your business name, your Designer profile picture and description, the last four digits of your credit card and your credit card expiry date.
	There may be additional information deemed personal data provided by you in briefs, on blogs or in comments or in interactions with other site users or otherwise while using our site, which is stored in our databases. This data may be monitored by us for trouble-shooting or maintenance purposes or if any form of abuse is suspected.
</p>
<h4>	Information we collect</h4>
<p>
	DesignCrowd will collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address in order to perform certain fraud checks as well as ensuring you are served the correct tax information while using our site. Your IP address helps us identify the relevant tax jurisdiction.
	Technologies such as “cookies” are used to allow the website to function, to collect useful information about visitors and to help make your user experience better. Cookies enable us to monitor traffic patterns and to serve you more efficiently if you revisit the site. A cookie does not identify you personally, but it does identify your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and this will provide you with an opportunity to either accept or reject each instance. We may allow some of our marketing or technology partners to utilise cookies on our website to collect non-personally identifying data to assist them, or DesignCrowd, in delivering services to you.
	We also collect information about your usage of the site when you are logged in. This will include which pages you visit, products or services that are ordered, payments that are made etc. This activity data is stored in our databases.
</p>
<h4>	Additional information provided by third parties</h4>
<p>
	DesignCrowd does receive some information from third parties, which is appended to the supplied and collected data. In order to use IP addresses effectively for fraud prevention purposes, location and other data related to the users IP address is received and stored. Further, in order to gain an additional data point for fraud checks as well as ensuring our marketing and customer service interactions are well received by our Clients, we use third parties to append names to email addresses. This allows us to match names for fraud and deliver appropriately addressed correspondence.
	When payments are processed by our payment processors, some information is provided back to DesignCrowd including a payment transaction reference number and any information relating to chargebacks and disputes. This information is critical to DesignCrowd being able to accurately record all financial data and deal with Client queries and disputes.
</p>
<h3>3	Data Security</h3>
