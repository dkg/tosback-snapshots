<p>Kahoot! provides a game-based learning platform, which brings fun into learning, for any subject, for all ages, letting users create, play and share learning games. Kahoot! Services are available for free or as a paid service in accordance with the following.</p>
<p>The Kahoot! Services that may be accessed subject to payment are currently referred to as ‚ÄúPaid Subscriptions‚Äù. You can learn more about Paid Subscriptions and the different service plans that we offer you to sign up for by visiting <a href="https://kahoot.com/schools/plans/">https://kahoot.com/schools/plans/</a> or <a href="https://kahoot.com/businesses/pricing/">https://kahoot.com/businesses/pricing/</a> (the ‚ÄúService Plans‚Äù). You agree to abide by the terms and restrictions applicable to the Service Plan that you have signed up for.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change or withdraw features, specifications, services and content of a Service Plan at any time, without notice to you. Please note that the content and features of a Service Plan may vary based on when you signed up and whether you have signed up through our website or via the App. The Kahoot! Services offered via the App may only contain a limited version of the web based services.</p>
<p>You can manage your Kahoot! user account here: <a href="https://create.kahoot.it/plus/org/billing/">https://create.kahoot.it/plus/org/billing/</a>. If you have purchased a Paid Subscription through a distribution platform such as Google Play or Apple App Store, you must manage your account through such platforms.</p>
<h3>4.1. Kahoot! Basic</h3>
<p>If you have signed up for our free Service, a limited version of our Kahoot! Services is provided to you free-of-charge, for as long as you use the Services for non-commercial purposes only, in accordance with the limitations of use set out in these Terms. The Service Plan that does not require payment is currently referred to as the ‚ÄúKahoot! Basic‚Äù. YOU MAY NOT USE KAHOOT! Basic FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. HENCE, IF YOU INTEND TO USE KAHOOT! SERVICES FOR PROFESSIONAL PURPOSES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IN CONJUNCTION WITH OR AS PART OF A PAID SERVICE OR PRODUCT, FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKETING YOUR OWN OR SOMEONE ELSE‚ÄôS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR OTHERWISE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A COMMERCIAL EVENT SUCH AS A CONCERT, GAME SHOW OR BROADCASTED EVENT, YOU MUST SIGN UP FOR A PAID SUBSCRIPTION OR ENTER INTO A SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH KAHOOT!.</p>
<h3>4.2. Paid Subscriptions</h3>
<p>Kahoot! offers various Service Plans for use of the Kahoot! Services in schools, businesses and non-profit organizations. Some Service Plans require payment before you can access them and certain areas of use are only permitted if you have signed up for a Paid Subscription or entered into a separate agreement with Kahoot!. If you have signed up for Paid Subscriptions, you may get access to features that are not available through Kahoot! Basic and you may use the Services for commercial purposes, only if and to the extent such commercial use is permitted under the selected Service Plan. You can learn more about Paid Subscriptions and the different Service Plans by visiting <a href="https://kahoot.com/businesses/pricing/">https://kahoot.com/businesses/pricing/</a> and <a href="https://kahoot.com/schools/plans/">https://kahoot.com/schools/plans/</a>.</p>
<h3>4.3. Pre-paid offers</h3>
<p>If you have received a code or other offer provided or sold by or on behalf of Kahoot! for access to a Paid Subscription (‚ÄúCode‚Äù), separate terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code may also apply to your access to the Service and you agree to comply with any such terms and conditions.</p>
<h3>4.4. Trials</h3>
<p>We may, at our own sole discretion, offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a discounted rate (a ‚ÄúTrial‚Äù). We reserve the right to revoke the Trial and put your account on hold in the event that we determine that you are not eligible.<br />
For some Trials, we‚Äôll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. We will charge you on a recurring basis for the selected subscription fee at the end of the Trial using the payment details you have provided us, unless you cancel your subscription prior to the end of the Trial.</p>
<p>You have provided your payment details in conjunction with the Trial and you accept that we charge you using such payment details. If you do not want this charge, you must cancel your Paid Subscriptions through your Kahoot! account‚Äôs settings or terminate your Kahoot! account before the end of the Trial. If you do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly or annual basis (as the case may be, depending on your Service Plan), you must cancel the applicable paid subscription through your Kahoot! account‚Äôs subscription page or terminate your Kahoot! account before the end of the recurring monthly period. Paid Subscriptions cannot be terminated before the end of the period for which you have already paid, and except as expressly provided in these terms, Kahoot! will not refund any fees that you have already paid.</p>
<h2>5. Payments, cancellations, upgrades</h2>
<h3>5.1. Payments and cancellations</h3>
<p>If you have signed up for Kahoot! Basic or if you cancel your Paid Subscription during the Trial, Kahoot! will never charge you any fees for your use of the Kahoot! Service.</p>
<p>Paid Subscriptions can be purchased directly from Kahoot! in the App or on our web site, or through a separate agreement with Kahoot!.</p>
<p>If you have signed up for a Paid Subscription for a monthly subscription fee, you will be charged for one month‚Äôs subscription fee in advance upon expiry of any Trial. The Paid Subscription and the payment to Kahoot! will automatically renew at the end of the monthly subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page before the end of the current monthly subscription period.</p>
<p>If you have signed up for a Paid Subscription which gives you access to the Kahoot! Service for a specific time period (‚ÄúPre-Paid Period‚Äù), you will be charged for the Pre-Paid Period in advance upon expiry of any Trial. The Paid Subscription and the payment to Kahoot! will automatically renew at the end of the Pre-paid Period unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page before the end of the Pre-paid Period.</p>
<p>If you cancel your Paid Subscription, the cancellation will take effect on the day after the last day of the current subscription period, after which you will be downgraded to Kahoot! Basic. We will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us.</p>
<p>Kahoot! may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Kahoot! Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Paid Subscription prior to the price change going into effect, in which case you will be downgraded to Kahoot! Basic.</p>
<p>We do not provide any refunds if the price for a Paid Subscription drops, or if we offer subsequent promotional pricing or change the content or features of a Service Plan. Paid Subscriptions purchased through other platforms are subject to the refund policies of those platforms. Kahoot! cannot be held responsible for these platforms&#8217; policies.</p>
<p>Please note that in the event you purchase a Kahoot! subscription, you are legally obliged to pay the invoice. This means that if you have not paid the invoice, but you have used our products/services, you are legally bound to pay the invoice</p>
<p>Your right to withdraw is revoked as soon as your subscription is activated, as activation immediately initiates full access to the features specified in the subscription. These features constitute our digital content.</p>
<h3>5.2. Upgrades and downgrades</h3>
<p>You may at any time upgrade or downgrade your Paid Subscription to a different Service Plan:</p>
<p><strong>Paid Subscriptions ‚Äì monthly:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have downgraded your monthly Paid Subscription to a lower Service Plan, such downgrade will take effect on the day after the last day of the current subscription period.</li>
<li>If you have upgraded your monthly Paid Subscription to a higher Service Plan, such upgrade will take effect immediately subject to payment of the upgrade fee.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Paid Subscriptions ‚Äì Pre-paid Period:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you have downgraded your Paid Subscription to a lower Service Plan during the Pre-paid Period, such downgrade will take effect on the date of renewal (i.e. the day after the last day of the Pre-paid Period).</li>
<li>If you have upgraded your Paid Subscription to a higher Service Plan during the Pre-paid Period, such upgrade will take effect immediately subject to payment of the upgrade fee and you will automatically enter into a new Pre-paid Period with the same duration as the preceding Pre-paid Period.</li>
</ul>
<h3>5.3. Taxes</h3>
<p>Prices listed may not include sales or value added tax and applicable tax may be calculated and added at the time you complete a transaction and, depending on where you have purchased your Paid Subscription, such tax may not be visible to you until you receive a receipt for your purchase. In certain jurisdictions, local laws require that prices include all applicable taxes, in which case this will be indicated at the time of the transaction.</p>

<p>The Kahoot! Service is based on user content and relies on users contributing content to the Service, including without limitation quizzes, pictures, video, text, messages, information, user feedback and any other content (‚ÄúUser Content‚Äù). You hereby grant to Kahoot! a perpetual (or, for as long as permitted under applicable law), non-exclusive, sub-licensable, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable, fully paid, universal license to commercialize, use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g. perform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content you have made available to the public in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created.

Where applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive any ‚Äúmoral rights‚Äù (or the equivalent under applicable law) such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.</p>
<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Kahoot!, (1) you have all rights necessary to upload such User Content to the Kahoot! Service and to grant the above license to Kahoot!, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Kahoot! as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements, applicable law, or the intellectual property (including without limitation copyright), publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Kahoot! or any rights holder without express written consent from such individual or entity.</p>
<p>Kahoot! may review, monitor, edit or remove User Content in our sole discretion, but is under no obligation to do so. In all cases, Kahoot! reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including but not limited to, User Content that, in Kahoot!‚Äôs sole discretion, violates the Agreements.

<h2>9. DMCA and User Content reporting</h2>
<p>The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the ‚ÄúDMCA‚Äù) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that material available in the Service infringes your copyright, you (or your agent) may send to Kahoot a written notice by mail or e-mail, requesting that Kahoot removes such material or blocks access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send to Kahoot a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/">http://www.copyright.gov/</a> for details. Notices and counter-notices must be sent in writing to Asmund Furuseth as follows: By mail to Asmund Furuseth, Kahoot! AS, Tordenskiolds gate 2, 0160 Oslo, Norway ; or by e-mail to asmund@kahoot.com. Asmund Furuseth‚Äôs phone number is +47 95764641. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a DMCA notice or counter-notice. Please note that Kahoot may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate or suspend users and accountholders who are repeat infringers.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Kahoot! may in its sole discretion take such actions as it deems fit in order to protect the intellectual property rights of any intellectual property owner, including but not limited to removing User Content.</p>
