<h3>Statistical Analysis:</h3>

<p class="term-text">In order to learn more about how

    used by others. Please exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal
    information in public activities or submissions.
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">From
    time to time, we may deploy technology such as application programming
    interfaces (or “APIs”) for use by third party application developers and make
    information concerning your public activities on the Sites, such as your
    comments on community message boards, available to third party websites and
    applications. If you use such third party websites and applications, they may

  </li>
  <li class="list-style">We may

<p class="term-text">We work closely with our affiliated

  our affiliates that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow
  practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy. In
  some cases, these affiliates may operate portions of the Sites or aspects of
  related services, or market or sell offerings to you. In other cases, we
  operate stores, provide services, or sell digital content or other offering
  jointly with these affiliates.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc17165262">5. Your choices, cookies and other
    tracking technologies and “do not track” signals</a></h2>

<h3>Deactivating your account</h3>

<p class="term-text">If the Sites functionality permits,
  you can deactivate your account at any time by visiting the preferences page
  for your profile or delete any content you provide from the Sites, though we
  may retain a copy of any deactivated accounts or deleted content for compliance
  purposes. When you deactivate your account, your user profile will be disabled,
  but your public comments will remain on the Sites. We have no responsibility,
  other than as may be required by applicable law, to take down, remove, or edit
  any of your public activities or any submissions that are a result of your
  public activities. For more information, please review our <a href="/about/terms_of_use">Terms
    of Use</a>.</p>

<h3>Cookies and other tracking technologies</h3>

<p class="term-text">Some information that is collected
  about you is collected automatically through cookies and other tracking
  technologies. Cookies are small amounts of information stored in files within
  your computer's browser. We may use these technologies to collect information
  about your activity, browser and device, and to collect information when you
  interact with services we offer through one of our third party partners, such
  as advertising. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default, but, if
  you prefer, you can usually remove or reject cookies through the settings on
  your browser or device. However, please note that removing or rejecting cookies
  could affect the availability and functionality of our Services. Please see our
  <a href="/about/cookie_policy">Cookie Policy</a> for more
  information about how we use cookies and your choices. <a name="_heading=h.gjdgxs"></a></p>

<h3>“Do not track” signals</h3>

<p class="term-text">The “do not track” (or “DNT”)
  concept has been promoted by regulatory authorities for the internet industry
  to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing internet users to control the
  tracking of their online activities across websites. Various web browsers offer
  a DNT option that sends a signal to websites visited by the user’s browser
  about the user's DNT preference. You can usually access your browser's DNT
  option in your browser's “preferences” or similar settings. As of the time of
  the posting of this Privacy Policy, there is no internet industry DNT
  technology standard. We take privacy and security seriously. With regard to
  DNT, the Sites do not currently respond to DNT signals in browsers because, as
  mentioned above, no DNT standard has been adopted. However, as explained above,
  you do have choices regarding how your browser handles cookies and other
  similar technologies. </p>

<h3>Third Party Online Advertising</h3>

<p class="term-text">Some of the advertisements you see
  on the Sites are from third parties, such as advertising agencies, advertisers,
  ad networks, and audience segment providers. These third parties may collect
  information about you and your online activities, either on the Sites or on
  other websites, through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to understand
  your interests and tailor certain advertisements to your interests.</p>

<p class="term-text">The Company does not have control
  over, or access to the information these non-affiliated third parties may
  collect. Such third parties' information practices are not covered by this Privacy
  Policy.</p>

<p class="term-text">If you choose to opt out of having
  your information used to deliver advertisements tailored to your interests, you
  will continue to see advertisements on the Sites, but these advertisements may
  not be as relevant to you.</p>

<p class="term-text">For more information about how we
  use cookies and your choices, please see our <a href="/about/cookie_policy">Cookie Policy</a>. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc17165263">6. Access</a></h2>

<p class="term-text">If you choose to share personal
  information with us, you may update or amend this information by contacting us
  at <a href="mailto:legal@mail.myanimelist.net">legal@mail.myanimelist.net</a>.
  Please include in your email the name of the Site(s) to which you provided the
  information you wish to amend.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc17165264">7. California Residents</a></h2>

<p class="term-text">This Section 7 applies to users who are California residents. We include this Section 7 in our
  Privacy Policy to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), and any
  terms defined in the CCPA have the same meaning when used in this Section 7.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Information We Collect</h3>

<p class="term-text pb16">We collect “personal information” as defined under the CCPA, which is information that
  identifies, relates to, describes, references, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or
  could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or
  device. Personal information does not include publicly available information from government
  records, deidentified or aggregated consumer information or information excluded from the

  unrelated, or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Sharing Personal Information</h3>

<p class="term-text">We may disclose your personal information to third parties for a business purpose. When we
  disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter into an agreement with the third
  party that describes the purpose and requires the third party recipient to both keep that personal
  information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the agreement. We
  may share your personal information with the categories of third parties described above in

  considered a “sale” of personal information under the CCPA. </p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Your Rights Under the CCPA</h3>

<p class="term-text">The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal
  information, as we describe further below.</p>

<p class="term-text-italic">Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights:</p>

<p class="term-text">As a California resident, you have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you
  about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we
  receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see below “Exercising Your CCPA
  Access, Data Portability and Deletion Rights”), we will disclose to you:</p>

<ul class="ul-list">
  <li class="list-style">The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
  <li class="list-style">The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
  <li class="list-style">The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
  <li class="list-style">The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data
    portability request).</li>
  <li class="list-style">If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate
    lists disclosing:
    <ul>
      <li class="list-dc">sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of
        recipient purchased; and</li>
      <li class="list-dc">disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories
        that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="term-text-italic">Deletion Request Rights:</p>

<p class="term-text">As a California resident, you have the right to request that we delete any of your personal
  information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we
  receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see below “Exercising Your CCPA Access, Data Portability and
  Deletion Rights”), we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information
  from our records, unless an exception applies. We may deny your deletion request if keeping the
  information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>

<ul class="ul-list">
  <li class="list-style">Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good
    or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of
    our ongoing business relationship with you, fulfill the terms of a written warranty or
    product recall conducted in accordance with federal law, or otherwise perform our
    contract with you.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal
    activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech
    rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code §
    1546 et. seq.).</li>
  <li class="list-style">Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the
    public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the
    information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s
    achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based
    on your relationship with us.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the
    context in which you provided it.</li>
</ul>

<p class="term-text-italic">Exercising Your CCPA Access, Data Portability and Deletion Rights:</p>

<p class="term-text">To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a
  verifiable consumer request to us by email at: <a
    href="mailto:legal@mail.myanimelist.net">legal@mail.myanimelist.net</a> or by regular mail at:
  MyAnimeList, Attn: Privacy Officer, 1-1-1 Hitotsubashi Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-0003 Japan.</p>

<p class="term-text">Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable
  consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request
  on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or
  data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must (a)
  provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom
  we collected personal information or an authorized representative and (b) describe your request
  with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We
  cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify
  your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to
  you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We
  will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
  requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>

<p class="term-text">We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of receipt,
  but if we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
  Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable
  consumer request’s receipt. If we cannot comply with the request, our response will explain the
  reasons we cannot comply. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your
  personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to easily transfer the
  information from one entity to another entity. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to
  your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we
  determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and
  provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

<p class="term-text-italic">Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights:</p>

<p class="term-text">If you are 16 years of age or older,
  you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information
  at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the personal information
  of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right
  to opt-in”)
  from either the consumer who is 13 to 15 years of age, or the parent or guardian
  of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to personal information
  sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</p>

<p class="term-text">To exercise the right to opt-out,
  you can click on the “Do not sell my data” link available on our homepage and other pages
  of this website. You will then have the option of clicking on a toggle button or checking a box and
  confirming your choice to opt-out. Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least
  twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may
  change your mind and opt back in to personal information sales at any time by clicking on the
  “Do not sell my data” link again and unchecking the box or clicking on the toggle button
  again and confirming your choice to opt back in.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Non-Discrimination</h3>

<p class="term-text">We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted
  by the CCPA, we will not do any of the following:</p>

<ul class="ul-list">
  <li class="list-style">Deny you goods or services.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting
    discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
  <li class="list-style">Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different
    level or quality of goods or services.</li>
</ul>

<p class="term-text">However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in
  different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will
  reasonably relate to your personal information’s value and contain written terms that describe the
  program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt
  in consent, which you may revoke at any time.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Other California Privacy Rights</h3>

<p class="term-text">If you are a California resident, under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section §
  1798.83) you may request further information about our practices related to disclosing your
  personal information to certain third parties and/or opt-out of our sharing of your personal
  information with unaffiliated third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Please
  send your request (with the subject line labeled “Your California Privacy Rights”) by email to

<h3>Information for parents and guardians:</h3>

<p class="term-text">The Company does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children or allow
  children to register without verifiable parental consent. The Sites are appropriate for a wide range of users, but the
  Company’s Sites are not directed to children. However, children under the age of 13 in the U.S. may access the Sites
  if, and only if, we have obtained verifiable parental consent from their parent or guardian in compliance with the
  Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Similarly, children under the age of 16 in Europe are only allowed
  to access the Sites with verifiable parental consent. If you are a parent or guardian of a child who wishes to access
  the Sites, please review our Privacy Policy (including the “California Residents” section above if your child is a
  resident of California) and discuss it with your child so that you and your child will understand our policies
  regarding the collection, use and sharing of personal information. If your child is in Europe, please also review the
  “Privacy Policy (for the users in EU/EEA)” below.</p>

<h3>Collection, use and sharing of children’s information:</h3>

<p class="term-text">We may collect, use and share personal information of children under the age 13 in the U.S. and
  under age 16 in Europe if it is collected from a child whose parent or guardian has provided verifiable parental
  consent. In such cases, and subject to our compliance with applicable law, we may collect personal information from
  children for any of the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy and may use, share, and otherwise process such
  information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality,
  security, and integrity of children’s personal information, including by taking reasonable steps to release such
  information only to third parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality, security and integrity. We retain
  children’s personal information only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and
  delete such information using reasonable measures to protect against its unauthorized access or use.</p>

<p class="term-text">In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 in
  the U.S. or under the age 16 in Europe without verification of parental consent, we will delete such information. If
  you are a minor age 13 or over in the U.S., a minor age 16 or over in Europe or an individual considered a child in
  another jurisdiction, you may only use the Sites with the permission and under the supervision of your parent or
  guardian.</p>

<h3>Parental consent, choices and access:</h3>

<p class="term-text">A parent or guardian who has given us permission to collect, use, and share their child's personal information can, at any time:</p>

<ul class="ul-list">
  <li class="list-style">Review, correct, or delete the child’s personal information; and/or</li>
  <li class="list-style">Revoke permission for us to further collect, use or share the child’s personal information.
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="term-text">To do any of the above,or if you have questions about parental consent, please contact us at <a
    href="mailto:legal@mail.myanimelist.net">legal@mail.myanimelist.net</a> with your request or question. Please
  be sure to include your child’s name and username and your name.</p>

<p class="term-text">We limit access to contact
  information about you to employees or service providers who we believe
  reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products
  or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We also have adopted
  commercially reasonable technical, physical, and administrative procedures to
  help protect information about you from loss, misuse, and alteration.<br>
  Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100%
  secure. We want you to feel confident using the Sites, but we cannot ensure or
  warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc17165267">10. Data Storage in Japan and the United States</a></h2>

<p class="term-text">Our offices are located in Japan. We store and process data for the Sites in Japan and may also
  store and process certain data in the United States. If you visit the Sites from another country, please be aware that
  information you provide to us or that we obtain as a result of your use of the Sites may be processed in and
  transferred to Japan and the United States and will be subject to Japan and U.S. law. By using the Sites or providing
  us with your information, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of information to and in
  Japan and the United States.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc17165268">11. Changes to this Privacy Policy</a></h2>

  by us from time to time and we reserve the right to do so at any time. Any
  amendments to the Privacy Policy will be posted here and the date indicated on
  the top of the Privacy Policy will state the date the Privacy Policy was last
  revised. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or
  share personal information that may impact you, we will notify you by sending
  an email to the email address associated with your user account (if you have
  chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise providing notice through
  the Sites. Before we use your personal information for a purpose that is
  materially different than the purpose we collected it for or that you later
  authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out. Your continued
  use of our Sites after any amendments to the Privacy Policy constitutes your
  acceptance of the new Privacy Policy. Information collected prior to the time

<p class="term-text">In the course of using our
  Services, you may provide us, directly and indirectly, with both personal and
  non-personal information. Personal information is information that can be used
  to identify you as an individual. Non-personal information is information that
  does not permit direct association with you. Both personal information and
  non-personal information may be used alone or in the aggregate with information
  collected from other users. Certain non-personal information would be
  considered a part of your personal information if it were combined with other
  identifiers (e.g., combining your zip or postal code with your street address)
  in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information
  are considered non-personal information if they are taken alone or combined
  only with other non-personal information (e.g., your viewing preferences). </p>

<p class="erm-text pb16">We describe the categories of personal information we may collect above in Section 2 of our
  Privacy Policy (“What information the Sites collect”). Some data we collect is necessary for

<h3>Persons and Entities with Whom We May Share Your

  Policy, we may share your information with non-affiliated third parties as follows:</p>

<ul class="ul-list">
  <li class="list-style">With Non-Affiliated Third Parties for Industry Analysis and Advertising<br>
    <p class="pb8">You agree that we
      may share technical information related to your device (such as IP address,
      Matching Number, or Device ID), aggregated non-personal information,
      anonymous information and, in some cases, personal information with advertisers, ad networks, and analytics
      analysis
      entities (&quot;Ad Entities&quot;) with whom we have strategic relationships,
      and Ad Entities may also be permitted to collect such information via cookies
      and other tracking technologies. This information may be used to undertake user
      trend analyses, demographic profiling, and analytics, and to provide to you
      tailored and personalized ads and advertising (behavioral advertising). Please
      note, though, that some Ad Entities also act as Service Providers (defined
      below) for us, and in those cases we may share your information as explained below.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">With Strategic Business Partners<br>
    <p class="pb8">We may share
      your information with our non-affiliated strategic business partners in
      connection with offering you co-branded services, selling or distributing our content,
      offering content or products that you may be interested in on our Services or on our
      partners’ services, or engaging in other joint marketing activities. We may also share
      aggregated information or certain personal information with such partners or other
      non-affiliated third parties to help us develop or provide you services, content, and
      advertising that may be of interest to you and our users.</p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">With our Service Providers<br>
    <p class="pb8">Sharing of your
      information may also occur where we engage or employ service providers,
      vendors, or other non-affiliated third parties to help us provide our Services
      (e.g., improvement of our Services' features, promotion and marketing,
      administration, analytics, customer service, cloud storage, hosting, and other
      related services) (“Service Providers”), to provide the Services on our behalf,
      or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are being used. Our Service
      Providers may have access to your personal information only to perform these
      tasks on our behalf, and they are obligated not to disclose or use your
      personal information for any other purpose. </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">With Third Party Developers<br>
    <p class="pb8">From time to time,
      as stated above, we may deploy technology such as APIs for use by third party
      application developers and make information concerning your public activities
      on the Services, such as your comments on community message boards, available
      to third party websites and applications. If you use such third party websites
      and applications, they may also collect, process and share your information,
      including personal information. You should review the privacy policies of any
      third party websites or applications before using them. </p>
  </li>
  <li class="list-style">With Certain Non-Affiliated Third Parties in Special Circumstances<br>
    <p class="pb8">At times, we may
      disclose information about you to law enforcement officials or private parties
      as we believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process
      (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of MAL or a third
      party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop
      activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical,
      or legally actionable activity. </p>
    <p class="pb8">Under another
      special set of circumstances, for example, we may share information about you
      in the event that the Services are acquired by a third party or third parties,
      or as part of a sale, merger, bankruptcy or change in control, or in
      preparation for any of these events.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="term-text">Once we share your information with
  another non-affiliated third party, the information received by that party
  becomes subject to the other party's privacy policies. Please note that
  non-affiliated third parties may independently collect data about you, through
  cookies, clicks on links, or other means when you visit or view ads on the
  Services.</p>

<p class="term-text">We work closely with our affiliated
  companies, such as our parent companies and their affiliated entities and
  subsidiaries under common ownership or control. We share your information with
  our affiliates that either are subject to this EU Privacy Policy or follow
  practices at least as protective as those described in this EU Privacy Policy.
  In some cases, these affiliates may operate portions of the Services or aspects
  of related services, or market or sell offerings to you. In other cases, we
  operate stores, provide services, or sell digital content or other offering
  jointly with these affiliates.</p>

<h3>Policy Regarding Children</h3>

  Services if, and only if, we have obtained parental consent from their parent or guardian. If you are a parent or
  guardian of a child in Europe who wishes to access our Services, please review this EU Privacy Policy and discuss it
  with your child so that you and your child will understand our policies regarding the collection, use and sharing of
  personal information. </p>

<p class="term-text">We may process personal information of children if it is collected from a child whose parent or
  guardian has provided verifiable parental consent. In such cases, and subject to our compliance with applicable law,
  we may collect personal information from children for any of the purposes set forth in this EU Privacy Policy and may
  use, share, and otherwise process such information as set forth in this EU Privacy Policy. We take reasonable measures
  to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of children’s personal information, including by taking
  reasonable steps to release such information only to third parties capable of maintaining its confidentiality,
  security and integrity. We retain children’s personal information only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose
  for which it was collected and delete such information using reasonable measures to protect against its unauthorized
  access or use. </p>

<p class="term-text">In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child in Europe
  without verification of parental consent, we will delete such information. If you are a minor age 16 or over in
  Europe, you may only use our Services with the permission and under the supervision of your parent or guardian. </p>

<p class="term-text">A parent or guardian who has given us permission to process their child's personal information can, with our verification of the identity of the parent or guardian, exercise the child’s rights
  including those discussed below under “Your Rights” in this EU Privacy Policy. </p>

<p class="term-text">This EU Privacy Policy may be
  amended by us from time to time and we reserve the right to do so at any time.
  Any amendments to the EU Privacy Policy will be posted here and the date
  indicated on the top of the EU Privacy Policy will state the date the EU
  Privacy Policy was last revised. If we make any material changes in the way we
  collect, use, and/or share personal information that may impact you, we will
  notify you by sending an email to the email address associated with your user
  account (if you have chosen to provide an email address) or by otherwise
  providing notice through the Services. Before we use your personal information for
  a purpose that is materially different than the purpose we collected it for or
  that you later authorized, we will provide you with the opportunity to opt out.
  Your continued use of our Services after any amendments to the EU Privacy Policy
  constitutes your acceptance of the new EU Privacy Policy. Information collected
  prior to the time any change is posted will be used according to the rules and
  law that applied at the time the information was collected. </p>
