If you are a Business User, you agree that, due to your receipt of Entitlements from such Business, (1) Adobe may provide such Business with the ability to access, use, remove, retain, and control your Business Profile and all Content therein whether uploaded or imported before or after the date these Terms were last updated; (2) your use of the Services and Software is governed by such Business’s agreement with Adobe; and (3) Adobe may provide your personal information to such Business. If you are a Business User with Entitlements from multiple Businesses, you may have separate Business Profiles associated with each Business. As a Business User, you may have different agreements with or obligations to a Business, which may affect your Business Profile or your Content. Adobe is not responsible for any violation by you of such agreements or obligations. If you did not receive Entitlements from a Business (e.g., you purchased a Creative Cloud for individuals plan and received Entitlements through this plan), then (a) you are a “<b>Personal User</b>”; (b) your Adobe profile is a personal profile; (c) you maintain sole access and control over all Content in your personal account or personal profile (except as otherwise indicated in the Privacy Policy); and (d) all references to “<b>you</b>” in these General Terms will mean you as an individual. If you received Entitlements through a personal plan and from a Business, then you are both a Personal User and a Business User. You are a Personal User when you utilize the Entitlements you obtained through your personal plan, and you are a Business User when you utilize your Entitlements provided by a Business.<br />

<p>1.4 <b>Business Email Domains.</b> As a Personal User or a Business User, you may create an Adobe account using an email address provided or assigned to you by a Business (such as your work email address). If the Business establishes a direct relationship with us, they may want to add your account to such relationship. If this happens, the Business may, with prior notice, roll your account into the Business’s account. This means the Business may (A) access the account; (B) take control over the account and any Content therein whether stored, uploaded, or imported before or after the date these Terms were last updated; and (C) recommend any non-Business Content associated with such account to be moved to a new account that utilizes an email address not associated with such Business. You, as an individual or a Business User, also acknowledge that Adobe may provide your personal information to such Business, such as your name or email address. If you do not want a Business to access, use, remove, retain, or control an account or profile, then do not use a Business email address with that account.

Additionally, you will provide us with all records and information requested by us within 30 days of our request in order for us to verify that the installation and use of any and all Services and Software is in conformity with your valid licenses. If the verification discloses a shortfall in licenses for the Services or Software, you will immediately acquire any necessary licenses, subscriptions, and applicable back maintenance and support.

If the laws of your jurisdiction give you the right to decompile the Services or Software to obtain information necessary to render the licensed portions of the Services or Software interoperable with other software, you must first request such information from us. We may, in our discretion, either provide such information to you or impose reasonable conditions, including a reasonable fee, on your decompilation of the Services or Software to ensure that our and our suppliers’ proprietary rights in the Services and Software are protected.</p>
