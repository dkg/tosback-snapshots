    <p>Effective date: December 12, 2018</p>
    <h3 id="a-definitions">A. Definitions</h3>
    <p class="short-version"><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We use these basic terms throughout the Agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There&rsquo;s not going to be a test on it, but it&rsquo;s still useful information.</em></p>
    <ol>
      <li>“Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the &ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) and all other operating rules, policies (including the WaniKani Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/privacy">wanikani.com/privacy</a>) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.</li>
      <li>“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, audio, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. &ldquo;Content&rdquo; also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. &ldquo;Your Content&rdquo; is Content that you create or own.</li>
      <li>“Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Tofugu.</li>
      <li>“Tofugu,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Tofugu, LLC., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</li>
      <li>“User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See <a href="#b-account-terms">Section B.4): Additional Terms</a>).</li>
      <li>“Website” or “WaniKani” refers to Tofugu’s website located at <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/">wanikani.com</a>, and all content, Services, and products provided by Tofugu at or through the Website. It also refers to Tofugu-owned subdomains of wanikani.com, such as <a href="https://api.wanikani.com">api.wanikani.com</a>. Occasionally, Websites owned by Tofugu may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or Service.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="b-account-terms">B. Account Terms</h3>
    <p class="short-version"><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; and you must provide a valid email address. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</em></p>
    <h4 id="1-required-information">1. Required Information</h4>
    <p>You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a <a href="#i-payment">paid account</a>, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>
    <h4 id="2-account-requirements">2. Account Requirements</h4>
    <p>We have a few simple rules for accounts on WaniKani&rsquo;s Service.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by &ldquo;bots&rdquo; or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>
      <li>You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young people excited to learn Japanese, we must comply with United States law. WaniKani does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will <a href="#j-cancellation-and-termination">terminate that User’s account immediately</a>. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</li>
      <li>You may not use as a username that is a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity without appropriate authorization. You may not use a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar, or obscene.</li>
      <li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="3-user-account-security">3. User Account Security</h4>
    <p>You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. WaniKani cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
      <li>You will promptly <a href="mailto:hello@wanikani.com">notify WaniKani</a> if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="4-additional-terms">4. Additional Terms</h4>
    <p>In some situations, third parties&rsquo; terms may apply to your use of WaniKani. For example, you may download an application that integrates with WaniKani. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties&rsquo; terms govern their relationships with you.</p>
    <h3 id="c-acceptable-use">C. Acceptable Use</h3>
    <p class="short-version"><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>While using the Service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the Service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.</em></p>
    <h4 id="1-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations">1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h4>
    <p>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.</p>
    <h4 id="2-content-restrictions">2. Content Restrictions</h4>
    <p>You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;</li>
      <li>is or contains sexually obscene content;</li>
      <li>is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;</li>
      <li>is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;</li>
      <li>contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or</li>
      <li>infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.</li>
    </ul>
