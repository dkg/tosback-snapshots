<p class="block">Other than as expressly provided for hereunder, CityGrid&#153; will never sell, rent, exchange or barter your personal information to or with any third party for financial gain or marketing purposes. By submitting your personal information on the Site, you agree that we may share such personal information (other than your Sensitive Information) with Third Party Service Providers that you request to be contacted by in order to complete your request for Third Party Offerings, and that the Third Party Service Providers may use such personal information for any lawful purposes, subject to any restrictions contained herein.

The ultimate terms and conditions of any Third Party Offerings provided by any Third Party Service Providers will be determined by those Third Party Service Providers.</b></p>
<p class="block">Where you register to access any of the CityGrid&#153; Offerings, we use the personal information that you make available to personalize your experience with the Site, facilitate the provision of the applicable CityGrid&#153; Offerings to you and for verification purposes.

Please note that you are not required to provide this consent in order to obtain access to the CityGrid&#153; Offerings, and your consent simply allows CityGrid&#153;, as well as the designated Third-Party Service Provider(s), to contact you via these means. <b>Please be advised that by agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are obligated to immediately inform us if and when the telephone number that you have previously provided to us changes.

<a id='behavioraltracking'></a>
<h4 class="h5 push">Behavioral Tracking/Do Not Track</h4>
<p class="block">As a general rule, other than as set forth below, neither CityGrid&#153;, nor any third parties, track the activity of Site Users in connection with the Site. However, when an Advertiser is logged into its account, we track changes in such Advertiser&#8217;s status and updates to its profile. We may use this activity data to target those Advertisers with more specific marketing messages. In addition, when an Advertiser opens or clicks on links in email marketing messages from us, we record that information and may use it to refine subsequent marketing messages. This tracking will usually occur even where the applicable Advertiser has selected the &#8220;do-not-track&#8221; option on its Internet browser.</p>
<p class="block">We use Google Analytics on the Site, as well as a conversion rate optimization platform called Visual Website Optimizer. These platforms do not record personal information of Site Users, but aggregate information and activity only.</p>
<h4 class="h5 push">Cross Device Tracking</h4>
<p class="block">CityGrid&#153; does not track Site Users&#8217; use of the CityGrid&#153; Offerings across multiple devices, including personal computers and mobile devices.</p>
<h4 class="h5 push">Other Websites</h4>
<p class="block">The Site may contain links to third-party owned and/or operated websites including, without limitation, websites owned and/or operated by our Third Party Service Providers. CityGrid&#153; is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. In some cases, you may be able to make a purchase through one of their third-party websites. In these instances, you may be required to provide certain information, such as a credit card number, to register or complete a transaction at such website. These third-party websites have separate privacy and data collection practices and CityGrid&#153; has no responsibility or liability relating to them.</p>
<a id='piisecurity'></a>
<h4 class="h5 push">Security of Your Personal Information</h4>
<p class="block">We endeavor to safeguard and protect our users&#8217; personal information. When users make personal information available to us, their personal information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain any personal information offline). The privacy of your personal information is very important to us. When our registration process asks users to submit Sensitive Information (such as credit card information), and when we transmit such Sensitive Information, that Sensitive Information is encrypted and is protected with Transport Layer Security (&#8220;TLS&#8221;) encryption software.</p>
<p class="block">Access to your personal information is strictly limited, and we take reasonable measures to ensure that your personal information is not accessible to the public. The servers that we store personal information on are kept in a secure physical environment. We also have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no storage facility, technology, software, security protocols or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
<p class="block">Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures may gain access to certain portions of your personal information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your personal information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software may constitute a crime punishable by law. For the reasons mentioned above, we cannot warrant that your personal information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through the Site is at your own risk.</p>
<p class="block">All of our users&#8217; personal information is restricted in our offices. Only employees or third party agents who need personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to personal information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user personal information. Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your personal information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.</p>
