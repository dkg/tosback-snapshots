                    <p>If the customer's storage space becomes full, the email account will not be able to receive any more emails.

                    <p>3.2 Posteo is generally available 24 hours a day. Posteo can make no guarantees about the continual availability of all services. Outages due to possible maintenance work will be advised of in advance.</p>

                    <p>4.1 In order to use Posteo, the customer is required to pay the monthly fee after sign-up. Payment by bank transfer or PayPal is to be made for 12 months in advance. If submitting payment by letter mail we only accept bank notes, therefore payment needs to be made for 15 months in advance. If the contract is ended prematurely (by either party) any remaining credit can be refunded. The customer can add a maximum of 120 EUR credit.</p>

                    <p>4.4 The customers are required to pay any fees that they incur as well as those arising from unauthorised use of their account by a third party, except where the use is not in the responsibility of the customer. The obligation to disprove culpability lies with the customer.</p>

                    <p>4.5 If the customer’s credit remains negative for two months despite warnings and reminder emails, the account’s ability to send emails will be blocked. After that, the contractual relationship will be ended by Posteo.</p>

                    <ul class="p_list p_list--smalldot">
                        <li>not to send any spam (and no more than 500 emails per hour and/or 1000 emails per day)</li>
                        <li>not to break German laws</li>
                        <li>not to break regulations regarding protection of children.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>6.2 Customers are liable to Posteo for damages resulting from a breach of their responsibilities under 6.1 and absolve Posteo from claims of any third parties in this regard. This does not apply when the unauthorised access had nothing to do with the customer. The obligation is on the customers to prove they had nothing to do with the usage.</p>

                    <p>6.3 If the customer uses Posteo against the conditions set out in 6.1 and 5.3, the account can be blocked by Posteo without notice. The right to immediate termination remains.</p>
