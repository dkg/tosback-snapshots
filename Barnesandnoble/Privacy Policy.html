What other information about Barnes &amp; Noble's Privacy Policy would I want to know?</h3><h3>Policies for Minors, including children under the age of 13</h3><p>Barnes &amp; Noble is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage and use of personal information of Minors under the age of 13, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.</p><p>Except as noted below : (i) our products and services are marketed for and directed towards purchase by adults or with the consent of adults; (ii) Individuals under the age of 18 ("Minors") are not permitted to use Barnes &amp; Noble Websites or Apps without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian; (iii) we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an online account or to post personal information on the Barnes &amp; Noble Websites; and (v) should we learn that someone under the age of 13 has provided any personal information to or on any of the Barnes &amp; Noble Websites, we will remove that information as soon as possible.</p><p>If we direct certain Devices features or Apps to Minors who may be under the age of 13, we require the parent or legal guardian to provide verifiable consent to such Minor's use of our products and services and our collection of personal information in connection with such use. In these cases, we require validation of credit card information already on file with us and we will then e-mail the master account holder to give notice that we have received such consent. If no credit card information is on file, or if the credit card is invalid, we will not register that you have consented. With your consent, we may collect, use and share information regarding Minors under the age of 13 consistent with this Privacy Policy. Please see the sections above for detailed information on how we do so.</p><p>If you are a parent or guardian who believes that your Minor under the age of 13 has submitted personal information or other information to us without your consent, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@barnesandnoble.com?subject=Privacy Policy">privacy@barnesandnoble.com</a>. Once we verify that you are the parent or legal guardian, at your request, we will promptly provide to you information regarding what, if any, personal information we have collected about your child and how it has been used or shared. We will, at your request, remove personal information about your child from its database and instruct our affiliates and third party partners to do the same.</p><p>If you are a Minor under the age of 18, you may request and obtain removal of certain content or information posted on Barnes &amp; Noble Websites and Apps by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@barnesandnoble.com?subject=Privacy Policy">privacy@barnesandnoble.com</a> with “Privacy Rights for Minors” in the subject line. Please be advised that our removal of your post(s) does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted on Barnes &amp; Noble Websites or Apps.</p><h3>Data retention policy</h3><p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p><h3>Authorized Agent</h3><p>You may use an authorized agent to submit a request to access your information, delete your information, or opt out of the sale of your information. To designate an agent for these purposes:</p><ol><li>You must provide us with a copy of a written and signed permission given to your authorized agent; and</li><li>You must verify your own identity directly with us.</li></ol><h3>Your California Privacy Rights</h3><p>California Civil Code 1798.115(c), 1798.130(a)(5)(c), 1798.130(c), and 1798.140 indicate that organizations should disclose whether certain categories of information are “sold” or transferred for an organization’s “business purpose” as those terms are defined under California law. You can find a list of the categories of information that we share <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/h/help/california-information-sharing-disclosure" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note that because this list is comprehensive it may refer to types of information that we share about people other than yourself. If you would like more information concerning the categories of personal information (if any) we share with third parties or affiliates for those parties to use for direct marketing please submit a written request to us using the information in the "Contact Information" section below. We do not discriminate against California consumers who exercise any of their rights described in this policy.</p><h3>Do Not Track Disclosure</h3><p>Certain web browsers may provide an option by which you may ask your browser to inform websites you visit that you do not wish your activities to be tracked by cookies or other persistent identifiers, commonly called "Do Not Track Signals". Although Barnes &amp; Noble Websites are currently unable to respond to Do Not Track Signals, you may opt out of tracking activities by following the instructions in this Privacy Policy to opt out of web analytics and behavioral advertising.</p><h3>Important information about third party devices, ISPs, websites and applications</h3><p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Barnes &amp; Noble enterprise. Whenever you click on links and banners on any Barnes &amp; Noble Website that take you to a third party website or you use, download or install third party software applications onto your Device, your use of those third party websites and/or software will be subject to the third party's privacy policies, not Barnes &amp; Noble's. Additionally, please note that when using Barnes &amp; Noble Websites or Apps, third party mobile device manufacturers and internet service providers (ISPs) may collect personal information about you and your use of such third party products and services will be subject to the third party's privacy policies.</p><p>In addition, our website includes links to other websites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Barnes &amp; Noble. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p><h3>Notice of Financial Incentive</h3><p>We provide price discounts, coupons, services and other benefits for (1) members of our Membership Program, Kid’s Club, Educator Program, Cafe and other customer programs; (2) large volume customers; (3) members of our mailing list; and (4) Barnes & Noble Account Holders (collectively “Programs”). Through these offerings, customers provide us with the necessary personal information (e.g., names, emails, phone numbers, educator credentials) when they opt-in to our programs. There is no obligation to opt-in and customers may opt-out at any time. The details of each Program are contained in the terms and conditions for each Program. We offer these Programs, among other things, to enhance our relationship with you so you can enjoy more of our products/services at a lower price. We invest heavily in our marketing and brands, in part, so we can provide Programs to our customers. The value to our business of customers’ personal information is dependent on specific facts such as whether and to what extent they, in the aggregate, take advantage of any offerings and whether and to what extent they opt-out of any offerings. Our ability to create any value from the Programs is heavily based on our ability to leverage said intellectual properties. We do not calculate the value of customer data in our accounting statements. To the extent we create overall value from our Programs to our business that could be directly or reasonably related to the value of customer data in the aggregate, the method for calculating same would include: the costs associated with (1) our intellectual property; (2) enhancing customer data by our marketing team’s efforts; (3) leveraging our significant investments in understanding you as our existing and future customers; (4) all other costs reasonably related to the programs and (5) for each program, and in the aggregate, whether the sales generated by the program(s) exceed the cost to us of offering them.</p><p>You can opt-in to, or opt-out of, our Programs at any time through the same means they are offered, or by emailing our Customer Service Department by calling Customer Service at 1-800-THE-BOOK <span class="strong">[1-800-843-2665]</span>.</p><h3>Information collected from visitors from outside the United States</h3><p>If you are visiting Barnes &amp; Noble or a Barnes &amp; Noble Website from outside the United States and provide us with personal information, please note that your personal information will be transferred, stored and processed within the United States. Additionally, Barnes &amp; Noble may transfer your personal information to other countries, for example because a server or third party service provider is located there. The data protection and privacy laws of other countries, including the United States, may not afford you the same level of protection as those in your own country. Barnes &amp; Noble will take appropriate steps to protect your information.</p><p class="strong">By doing business or interacting with Barnes &amp; Noble, you are consenting to the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information to and within facilities located in the United States and other facility locations selected by Barnes &amp; Noble.</p><h3>Terms of Use</h3><p>Any dispute between you and us regarding the privacy of your personal information is subject to this Privacy Policy and the terms of use or terms of service applicable to our product or service you use, including limitation on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the State of New York.</p><h3>Contact Information</h3><p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, you may contact us by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@barnesandnoble.com?subject=Privacy Policy">privacy@barnesandnoble.com</a>. You may also mail inquiries and concerns to: Barnes &amp; Noble 33 East 17th Street, New York, NY 10003.</p><p class="strong">Effective Date: February 1, 2021</p></div></div></div></div></div>
