<h3 id="the-observable-terms-of-service">The Observable Terms of Service</h3>
<p>Effective date: March 12, 2019</p>
<h3 id="a-definitions">A. Definitions</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, and notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the “Terms”) and all other operating rules, policies, and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website.</li>
<li>The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Observable.</li>
<li>The “Website” refers to Observable’s website located at <a href="https://observablehq.com/">observablehq.com</a>, and all content, services, and products provided by Observable at or through the Website. It also refers to Observable-owned subdomains of observablehq.com, such as api.observablehq.com and ancillary websites, such as observableusercontent.com.</li>
<li>“The User,” “The Customer,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. Individual users must be at least 13 years of age.</li>
<li>“Observable,” “We,” and “Us” refer to Observable, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</li>
<li>An “Account” represents your legal relationship with Observable. A “User Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on Observable. A “Team Account” refers to an Account created by a User on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit organization, or group. “Teams” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many notebooks at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Teams.</li>
<li>“Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. “Content” also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Your Content” is Content that you create or own.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b-account-terms">B. Account Terms</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>User and Team Accounts have different administrative controls. A human must create your account. You must be at least 13 years old. You must provide a valid external identity. You may not have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</em></p>
<h4 id="1-account-controls">1. Account Controls</h4>
<ul>
<li>Users. All Users retain ultimate administrative control over their User Accounts and the Content within them.</li>
<li>Teams. Within the Service, the Team creator must designate one or more User Accounts as “owners” who are delegated ultimate administrative control of the Team. The owners of each Team retain administrative control over the members of those Teams and all User-Generated Content posted to the notebooks within those Teams, subject to these Terms. Team members can manage User access to the Team’s data and notebooks.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="2-required-information">2. Required Information</h4>
<p>You must log in with a valid email address — or a supported identity provider, such as GitHub, linked to a valid email address — in order to complete the signup process. For User Accounts, any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional. To complete signup for Team Accounts, a company name, your real name, and valid payment information must also be provided.</p>
<p>If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into the Agreement and bind the entity to these Terms.</p>
<h4 id="3-account-requirements">3. Account Requirements</h4>
<p>You must create a User Account before you can create a Team Account. We have a few simple rules for accounts on Observable.</p>
<ul>
<li>You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>
<li>One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account.</li>
<li>You may not create an Account for the use of anyone under the age of 13. While we are thrilled to see brilliant youngsters get excited by exploring data sets and visualizing algorithms, we must comply with United States law. Observable does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older. In such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.</li>
<li>Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Team Account may only provide access to as many User Accounts as it has paid for.</li>
<li>Overall, the number of Users accessing Team notebooks associated with your Team Account must not exceed the number we have authorized for your Team Account.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-user-account-security">4. User Account Security</h4>
<p>You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even if the content is posted by others).</li>
<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account. Observable cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
<li>You will promptly notify Observable if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, by sending an email to <a href="mailto:support@observablehq.com">support@observablehq.com</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="c-acceptable-use">C. Acceptable Use</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>Observable hosts a wide variety of collaborative notebooks from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be courteous to each other, and don’t spam.</em></p>
<h4 id="1-compliance-with-laws-and-regulations">1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations</h4>
<p>Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.</p>
<h4 id="2-content-restrictions">2. Content Restrictions</h4>
<p>You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:</p>
<ul>
<li>is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;</li>
<li>is or contains sexually obscene content;</li>
<li>is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;</li>
<li>is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group;</li>
<li>contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or</li>
<li>infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="3-conduct-restrictions">3. Conduct Restrictions</h4>
<p>While using Observable, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including Observable employees, officers, and agents, or other Observable Users;</li>
<li>use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;</li>
<li>attempt to disrupt or tamper with Observable’s servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on Observable’s servers through automated means, or to access Observable’s Service in ways that exceed your authorization;</li>
<li>impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with Observable, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site’s purpose; or</li>
<li>violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person’s personal information without consent.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-services-usage-limits">4. Services Usage Limits</h4>
<p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without Observable’s express written permission.</p>
<h4 id="5-scraping">5. Scraping</h4>
<p>Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or web crawler. You may scrape the website solely for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search engines may scrape public pages on the Website for inclusion into search indexes.</li>
<li>Archivists may scrape public pages on the Website for archival purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may not scrape Observable for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Observable users’ personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.</p>
<p>All use of Observable data gathered through scraping must comply with the Privacy policy, described in <a href="#d-privacy">Section D</a>.</p>
<h4 id="6-data-collection-and-privacy">6. Data Collection and Privacy</h4>
<p>Misuse of Observable Users’ Personal Information is prohibited.</p>
<p>Any person, entity, or service collecting data from Observable must comply with the Privacy policy described in <a href="#d-privacy">Section D</a> of this Agreement, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users’ Personal Information. If you collect any Observable User’s Personal Information from Observable, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from Observable, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and “do not contact” requests from Observable or Observable Users.</p>
<h4 id="7-excessive-bandwidth-use">7. Excessive Bandwidth Use</h4>
<p>If we determine your bandwidth usage to be excessive in relation to other Observable users, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your notebook hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.</p>
<h4 id="8-user-protection">8. User Protection</h4>
<p>You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.</p>
<h3 id="d-privacy">D. Privacy</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We collect your information only with your consent. We only collect the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us. We don’t sell your personal information to third parties and we only use it as this Agreement describes.</em></p>
<h4 id="1-information-observable-collects">1. Information Observable Collects</h4>
<p>We may collect basic browsing information from all visitors to the Website, including the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We may also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.</p>
<p>If you log in to Observable, we may require additional information: a valid email address, name, avatar image, biographical paragraph, and an account name from a supported identity provider.</p>
<p>If you sign up for a Team Account, we may require additional information: a valid business name, a business URL, a designated User to act as an owner of the team, and valid payment information.</p>
<p>“User Personal Information” is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.”</p>
<p>User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.</p>
<h4 id="2-what-information-observable-does-not-collect">2. What Information Observable Does Not Collect</h4>
<p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Observable does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a notebook. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, and you are responsible for complying with any regulatory controls regarding that data.</p>
<p>We do not intentionally collect User Personal Information that is stored in your notebooks or any other free-form content inputs. Information in your notebooks belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>If your notebook has been published and is now public, anyone (including Observable employees) may view its contents. If you have included private or sensitive information in your public notebook, such as email addresses, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. In addition, while we do not generally search for content in your private notebooks, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures, or for known active malware.</p>
<h4 id="3-how-we-share-the-information-we-collect">3. How We Share the Information We Collect</h4>
<p>We do share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested or communicate on your behalf. For example, if you suggest a notebook to another Observable User, we will send them an email including your name and Observable login, and a link to your suggested notebook. If you join a Team Account, the other members of the team will be able to view and edit any team notebooks you create. We will respect your choices.</p>
<p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes.</p>
<p>We do not host advertising on Observable. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. Any advertisements on individual Observable notebooks are not sponsored by, or tracked by, Observable.</p>
<p>We do not disclose User Personal Information outside Observable, except in the situations listed in this section or when compelled to by law.</p>
<p>We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use Observable. For example, we may compile statistics on the usage of open source libraries across Observable. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers.</p>
<p>We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested.</p>
<p>We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar those in our Terms of Service. Our vendors may perform services such as payment processing, sending email on our behalf, content delivery networking, error log analysis, and other similar services.</p>
<p>We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information.</p>
<h4 id="4-public-information-on-observable">4. Public Information on Observable</h4>
<p>Much of Observable is public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as internet archives, to compile public-facing Observable information.</p>
<p>Your Personal Information, associated with your content, may be gathered by third parties in these compilations of Observable data. If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third parties’ compilations of Observable data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available.</p>
<h4 id="5-cookies">5. Cookies</h4>
<p>Observable uses cookies (and similar technologies, such as HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of Observable. The cookies Observable sets are essential for the operation of the website or are used for performance or functionality. By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use the Service.</p>
<p>Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. Or another user’s notebook may embed a third party video. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can’t always control what cookies this third party content sets.</p>
<h4 id="6-tracking-and-analytics">6. Tracking and analytics</h4>
<p>We use a number of third party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our users’ use of Observable, compile statistical reports on activity, and improve our content and website performance. In addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our service and performance.</p>
<p>We do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track our users’ activity over time on Observable. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services.</p>
<h3 id="e-user-generated-content">E. User-Generated Content</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You own the content you create, but you allow us certain rights, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.</em></p>
<h4 id="1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content">1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</h4>
<p>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you or Team Users post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>
<h4 id="2-observable-may-remove-content">2. Observable May Remove Content</h4>
<p>We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Observable terms or policies.</p>
<h4 id="3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants">3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants</h4>
<p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you’re posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you and your Team Users are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.</p>
<p>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Observable Users — certain legal permissions, listed in <a href="#4-license-grant-to-us">Sections E.4 — E.6</a>. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Observable the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in <a href="#4-license-grant-to-us">Sections E.4 — E.6</a>. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.</p>
<h4 id="4-license-grant-to-us">4. License Grant to Us</h4>
<p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users you choose to show it to; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users you choose to share it with; run it in a notebook environment; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video. We need these rights for both public and private notebooks because these rights are necessary for providing the Service.</p>
<p>This license does not grant Observable the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.</p>
<h4 id="5-license-grant-to-other-users">5. License Grant to Other Users</h4>
<p>Any User-Generated Content you or your Team Users post publicly may be viewed by others. By publishing your notebooks, you agree to allow others to view, “import” and “fork” your notebooks. This means that others may load your published Content into notebooks they control, or make their own copies of your published Content in notebooks they control.</p>
<p>When you publish a notebook, you grant each User of Observable a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Observable Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on Observable as permitted through Observable’s functionality (for example, through forking). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Observable Users.</p>
<h4 id="6-contributions-under-a-notebook-license">6. Contributions Under a Notebook License</h4>
<p>Whenever you make a suggestion to a notebook containing notice of a license, you license your suggestion under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your suggestion under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede. This style of collaboration is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community, where it’s commonly referred to by the shorthand “inbound=outbound”.</p>
<h4 id="7-moral-rights">7. Moral Rights</h4>
<p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in <a href="#4-license-grant-to-us">Section E.4</a>, but not otherwise.</p>
<p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Observable the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.</p>
<h3 id="f-private-notebooks">F. Private Notebooks</h3>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You may have access to private notebooks. We treat the content of private notebooks as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, to fix errors in the Service, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.</em></p>
<h4 id="1-control-of-private-notebooks-">1. Control of Private Notebooks.</h4>
<p>User Accounts and Team Accounts may have private notebooks, which allow the User or Team to restrict access to Content.</p>
<h4 id="2-confidentiality-of-private-notebooks-">2. Confidentiality of Private Notebooks.</h4>
<p>Observable considers the contents of private notebooks to be confidential to you or your team. Observable will protect the contents of private notebooks from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.</p>
<h4 id="3-access-">3. Access.</h4>
<p>Observable employees may only access the content of your private notebooks in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If Observable accesses a private notebook for support reasons, we will ask for and obtain the notebook author’s permission first.</li>
<li>When access is required for maintenance reasons, to fix an error in the Service, or to upgrade notebooks for a new version of the Service.</li>
<li>When access is required for security reasons, including to prevent abuse, and to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of Observable’s systems and Service.</li>
<li>When access is required for analytics reasons, to learn how Observable users are making use of the Service.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="4-exclusions-">4. Exclusions.</h4>
<p>If we have reason to believe the contents of a private notebook are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them.</p>
<p>Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose User Personal Information or the contents of your private notebooks in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large.</p>
<p>In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, we strive for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances.</p>
