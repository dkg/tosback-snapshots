<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>


<p>This is a legal agreement between users of this service ("you" or "your") and
Ankitects Pty Ltd, a company started by the Anki author. This agreement
governs your usage of AnkiWeb ("the service"). In this document,
"we" and "our" refers to Ankitects Pty Ltd, its staff, and trusted third-party
    contractors.</p>

<h2>Legal Age</h2>

<p>If you are not old enough to legally agree to this document, please have a parent or guardian agree on your behalf.</p>

<h2>Privacy</h2>

<p>Please see our <a href="/account/privacy">privacy policy</a> to understand the
information we store when you use the service, why we store it, and the limited
ways in which we share it.</p>

<h2>Account Expiry</h2>

<p>As AnkiWeb is a free service, we need to periodically delete unused account
data to keep costs down. Decks stored in your account <a href="https://anki.tenderapp.com/kb/anki-ecosystem/ankiweb-account-removal">will expire</a> if
your account is not accessed in 6 months or longer.</p>

<h2>Acceptable Content</h2>

<p>By uploading or entering any material into our website, you assert that it
    does not contain:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Content that you do not have the intellectual property rights to
            use, due to copyright, trademark, patent or other protection. Your
            local jurisdiction may allow you to use protected content under
            fair use provisions, provided you do not share it with others.
        </li>
        <li>Content designed to subvert the correct functioning of software or
        hardware, such as viruses and code exploits.
        <li>Content that is illegal in Australia, Germany, the United
        States, or your country of residence.
      </ul>

<p>If you are an intellectual property holder and believe your rights have been
    violated, please see the "Intellectual Property Violations" section below.</p>

<p>If you share your material publicly, you must also ensure:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It does not contain content that might offend others, such as pornography, hate speech or libel.
    <li>It does not attempt to modify or replace the function, content or branding of our website.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sharing Decks</h2>

<h3>Sharing</h3>

<ul>
    <li>You may optionally share a deck you have uploaded, making it available
        for others to download from AnkiWeb.</li>
    <li>When you share a deck, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive license to make the deck available to users under
        the Shared Deck License below.</li>
    <li>You further grant us the right to modify the deck you shared,
        including but not limited to creating excerpts, and converting to new file
        formats.</li>
    <li>You may elect to remove the shared deck from our servers at any time.
        This will stop us from providing the deck for download. We do not store records
        of who has downloaded a certain deck, so we can not retroactively remove
        a deck from users who have already downloaded it. Due to
        caching, there may be a small delay between when you remove a deck
        and when it becomes unavailable to others.</li>
    <li>In addition to the license you grant us above, you may optionally
    grant users extra rights by specifying so in your deck's description, such as
    allowing them to redistribute modified versions of your deck. You may
    not impose any extra restrictions.</li>
    <li>When you share a deck, you will be required to assert that it is
        entirely your own work, or that you have obtained a license from the
        intellectual property holder to share the material here. If we suspect
        that material has been uploaded in violation of intellectual property
        rights, we will remove it from the shared deck list, and may remove your
        ability to share decks in the future.
    </li>
    <li>The system will automatically remove shared decks that receive very few
        downloads after 3 months.</li>
    <li>While we do not have the resources to manually check decks that are
    uploaded to our website, we reserve the right to remove any we come across
    that we deem inappropriate, including but not limited to ones with poor
    quality descriptions or content, and ones that are only useful to a small
    group of people (such as lecture notes for a specific class).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Shared Deck License</h3>

<ul>
    <li>When you download a deck that someone has shared, the deck author
    grants you a permanent, non-revocable, worldwide, royalty free,
    non-exclusive license to use the material in your personal studies.</li>
    <li>This license is for personal use only, and the deck may not be
        redistributed, re-uploaded, published, or used for any other purposes
        without explicit permission from the copyright holder.</li>
    <li>Shared decks have been provided by third parties and are not reviewed
    by us, so we can offer no warranty or support for them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Intellectual Property Violations</h3>

<p>Each time users share a deck, they're required to confirm that the content is
entirely their own work, or that they have obtained a license from the
intellectual property holder. If you believe someone has violated your
intellectual property rights, please post a private message on our <a
href="http://help.ankisrs.net">support site</a> to let us know. Please provide
us with a link to the offending content, and a link to your site, book or other
original content that the material has been taken from. If you are writing on
behalf of another, you must have the authority to act on their behalf. Please be
advised that if you make a false report, you may place yourself open to legal
action.</p>

<h2>Sharing Add-ons</h2>

<ul>
    <li>You may optionally share an add-on you have created by uploading it to
        AnkiWeb, and you may download add-ons that others have shared.</li>
    <li>As add-ons extend the computer version, they must be licensed under
    the AGPL3 or a compatible license. If you do not explicitly state a
    license, it will be assumed to be AGPL3.</li>
    <li>Add-ons do not run in a protected environment, so they potentially
    have full access to your computer. Please understand that add-ons are
    provided by third parties, and not verified by us, so we can provide
    absolutely no warranty. You should only use add-ons that you trust.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="access">Access to the Service</h2>

<ul><li>You may access AnkiWeb directly through your browser, and through the
synchronisation functionality incorporated into the approved clients (Anki,
AnkiMobile, AnkiDroid, and AnkiUniversal).

<li>Because other clients can cause problems, AnkiWeb does not currently
allow access from browser extensions or other third-party clients. Instead,
please use <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159">AnkiConnect</a>,
which lets you modify your local connection over a web socket without any
negative impact on AnkiWeb.

<li>As the service is provided to you at no charge, we reserve the right to
  suspend or remove your access to the service at our sole discretion.
</ul>

<h2>Violations &amp; Law Enforcement</h2>

<p>If you fail to comply with these terms of service, we may suspend or remove
your account at our sole discretion. If your actions were illegal, we may also
report you to the authorities. We will provide your information to third
parties when required to do so by law.</p>

<h2>Money</h2>

<p>Use of the service is currently free, and the hosting costs are supported by
sales of the <a href="http://ankisrs.net/docs/AnkiMobile.html">iPhone
app</a>. As the hosting
costs continue to grow, we may need to introduce a "freemium" model in the
future, where basic accounts are free, and people can pay for accounts that
support larger decks or extra features.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>If we make significant changes to these terms, we will notify you via a
message on the website, a message when you sync, or via an email.
</p>

<h2>Transfer</h2>

<p>In the event of a company acquisition, restructure, or bankruptcy, we may transfer these rights
    and obligations to the new legal entity.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

<p>Use of the service is at your own risk. While we endeavor to ensure the
integrity of your data, ultimately the responsibility is in your hands. Please
    keep a local backup of your data for safety's sake.</p>

<P> THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS". WHEN ALLOWED BY LOCAL LAW, WE HEREBY
    DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE
    SERVICE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR THAT ACCESS WILL BE CONTINUOUS OR
    UNINTERRUPTED. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR
    DISCRETION AND RISK.</P>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p> TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR
    ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR OTHER DAMAGES,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF DATA, INCORRECT DATA, BUSINESS
    INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES INCURRED BY YOUR USE OF, OR
    INABILITY TO USE THIS SERVICE, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.
