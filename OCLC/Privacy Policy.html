  <h2>Legal Basis for Processing</h2> 
  <p>We use this personal information for the legitimate interests identified above, to perform the contracts we enter into with you or with our institution customers and as required by law. If we use consent as the legal basis for processing your information, we will seek separate consent for such use. In the event that OCLC identifies a new purpose outside of the stated purposes listed above, we will update this policy and provide any other notification required by law.</p> 
  <h2>With Whom Do We Share Your Information?</h2> 
  <p>We may share your information with the following categories of recipients:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Third-party service providers. OCLC contracts with third-party service providers and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples of such third-party service providers include, but are not limited to, event coordinators, vendors that facilitate surveys, webinars, and email marketing communications, payment processors, and analytics providers. Such parties have access to your information as necessary to complete their functions;</li> 
   <li>Partner Organizations. If we are collaborating with an identified partner for a particular event, we will share registration information with that collaborating partner. We also share registration information with organizations that have contributed course or webinar content. These organizations are identified in the course catalog;</li> 
   <li>Social media platforms. Some of the Services make use of integrated social media functionality that will allow you to easily share certain content on various social media platforms. When you are using a Service that provides integrated social media functionality, information may be shared with those social media platforms, regardless of whether or not you are a registered user of a social media platform. Please refer to the various social media platform privacy statements and terms of service for additional information;</li> 
   <li>In connection with membership. We may disclose certain information about individuals affiliated with OCLC member institutions to other member institutions or to regional or global council members to fulfill our obligations with respect to OCLC membership and to allow our OCLC members to take full advantage of membership;</li> 
   <li>In connection with job applications. We may share your personal information with authorized OCLC corporate personnel and subsidiary human resources personnel as needed, as well as third parties who are acting on OCLC’s behalf, namely those who (i) perform recruiting services, such as employment reference checks, interview scheduling, application tracking, and employment screenings; and (ii) provide IT services, such as hosting and cloud providers;</li> 
   <li>Compliance with legal obligations. We may disclose your information, at our discretion and without prior notice, to law enforcement or other public authorities in order to comply with a law, regulation, investigation, valid legal process, or other similar requests;</li> 
   <li>Protection of OCLC and others. We may disclose your information for purposes of fraud detection and prevention, to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, or to protect the rights, property and safety of OCLC, you, or others;</li> 
   <li>Business transactions. In the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, re-organization, consolidation, sale of assets, or other business transaction, OCLC may disclose or transfer your information;</li> 
   <li>OCLC affiliate entities. We may share your information among OCLC affiliates for the purposes set forth herein;</li> 
   <li>General public and other members. We allow you to post on public parts of our Services, such as through WorldCat.org and the OCLC Community Center. Please be aware that any information you post on a public forum, such as public content on WorldCat.org or Community Center, will be available to the public in real time. You may also choose to make certain portions of your profile information public or private through "My Profile" functionalities with certain Services. The portions of your profile you make public will be available to other uses of that Service (for example users of WorldCat.org or WebJunction); and</li> 
   <li>State library agencies. For certain OCLC Services (e.g. WebJunction), we share registration information with supporting state library agencies for continuing education purposes.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>These third parties are not authorized to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf pursuant to a contractual obligation or to comply with legal requirements. OCLC requires such third parties to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations and to agree to implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard your personal information.</p> 
  <h2>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</h2> 
  <p><a href="https://policies.oclc.org/en/privacy/cookie-statement.html">For information about how OCLC uses cookies and other tracking technologies and behavioral advertising click here</a>.</p> 
  <h2>External Links</h2> 
  <p>The Websites contain links to other sites. Such links do not imply OCLC's endorsement or guarantee of the products, information or recommendations provided by any third party. Please be aware that OCLC is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third party sites or applications. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every site or application that collects your information. This Statement applies solely to information collected through OCLC Services.</p> 
  <h2>Third party social plugins</h2> 
  <p>Our Services may have integrated third party social plugins, and the use of such plugins results in collection of data by OCLC and could result in the relevant third party recording your interactions, too. For example, if you share our posts, a third-party plugin could result in the third party collecting information about your access of our Services.</p> 
  <h2>Security</h2> 
  <p>We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the protection of your information, and to prevent the loss, misuse, or alteration of that information. We use reasonable security procedures to protect against unauthorized or unlawful access, processing, disclosure, alteration, destruction or accidental loss of your personal data. We limit access to and use of your personal data to authorized persons and trusted third parties who have a reasonable need to know the information in order to perform our business operations and who are bound by confidentiality obligations.</p> 
  <p>You are also responsible for the security of your account. For example, your password is a component of our security system, and, as such, it is your responsibility to protect it. Do not share your password with any third parties. If your password is compromised, you should change it immediately and contact us.</p> 
  <h2>Retention of Data</h2> 
  <p>We will keep your information as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which information is collected as stated herein; for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us, if any; and to comply with applicable legal, statutory, or regulatory obligations to maintain the data. For example, where required by law for tax, trade and corporate requirements, agreements, or disputes.</p> 
  <p>When we no longer need your information for our purposes or legal obligations, we will destroy, delete or erase that information or convert it into an anonymous form.</p> 
  <h2>Children</h2> 
  <p>We understand the importance of taking precautions to protect the privacy and safety of children using our Services. Our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13.</p> 
  <p>If we learn that we have collected the information of a child under 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete the information from our records. Please notify us if you know we have collected information of a child under 13 so we can delete the information.</p>
