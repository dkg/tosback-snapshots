    <h2 id="Introduction" style="padding-top:90px;">1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Hulu, LLC (“Hulu,” “we” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and sharing of information from or about you, including personal information, in connection with your use of the Hulu Services. The term “Hulu Services” refers to our video service, including the selection of television shows, clips, movies, and other content we offer (collectively, the “Content”) and our player for viewing the Content (the “Video Player”), as well as any other products, features, tools, materials, or other services offered from time to time by Hulu through a variety of Access Points. The term “Access Points” refers to, collectively, the hulu.com website (the “Hulu Site”), applications, and other places through which the Hulu Services may be accessed, including websites and applications of Hulu’s third-party distribution partners and other websites where users or website operators are permitted to embed or have otherwise licensed the Video Player. The information practices of third-party Access Points are governed by their own privacy policies and are not governed by this Privacy Policy; accordingly, we recommend you review the privacy policies of these third parties. Please also note that the Hulu Services may contain links to other sites owned or operated by other companies, including our advertisers, and Hulu does not notify you when you have chosen to click through to another website or property when using the Hulu Services. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of such other websites or properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      By viewing any Content or otherwise using the Hulu Services, whether you are a subscriber, other registered user, or a visitor who has not subscribed to or registered for the Hulu Services, you consent to the collection and use of information from or about you as explained in this Privacy Policy. <strong>If you do not consent to the collection and use of information from or about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, then you may not use the Hulu Services.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that the website addresses (i.e., URLs) included within this Privacy Policy may not function as hyperlinks on all the Access Points. To view this Privacy Policy with clickable hyperlinks, please visit the Hulu Site on your computer.

  <div style="margin-bottom:-90px;">
    <h2 id="InfoWeCollect" style="padding-top:90px;">2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Hulu may collect the following information from or about you, including personal information, from the following sources:</p>
    <p>
      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Information You Provide to Us.</span> We collect information you provide to us. For instance, when you register to use the Hulu Services, we may collect identifiers and personal information including your name, email address, credit card or other payment method information, address, ZIP code, characteristics such as your age (birth date) and gender, and other information. In addition, Hulu may collect similar information you provide to us when you respond to surveys or interactive ad units, contact Hulu through customer service or communicate with us by other means, or participate in promotions or events. We may also collect information you provide as part of selecting your preferences, including within your account settings, and commercial information, such as the Hulu plan(s) you purchase. Hulu allows multiple profiles to be set up under one account, so we may collect information you provide to us if you create a profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Usage, Technical and Log Data.</span> We collect information when you use the Hulu Services or interact with Hulu, including when you view Hulu advertising outside of the Hulu Services. We may collect information from and about the browser or device you’re using and information about your internet or other electronic network activity, including through analytics tools and the technologies described below (“Data Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies”). This information may include your IP address, device type, browser and software characteristics (such as type and operating system), geolocation data (which may include precise location data), referral URLs, network state, device identifiers or other unique identifiers such as advertising identifiers (e.g., “ad-ID” or “IDFA”) and identifiers associated with browser cookies (see our description of “Cookies and Local Storage” below), and carrier information.  We also collect information about your activity on the Hulu Services including information about the content you view on Hulu such as series titles and episode names (“Viewing Information”), page views, and ads you have viewed on Hulu.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Data Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies.</span> Like many online services, we use various technologies to collect usage data and store preferences. These technologies are discussed below.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>Cookies and Local Storage.</i> A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Hulu Services or Hulu advertising published outside of the Hulu Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Hulu Services, and to customize Content and advertising. These uses allow us to improve the Hulu Services. We may create a unique device or user ID for you and store it in a cookie so we can customize your experience based on your preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may collect information through other kinds of local storage (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, including in connection with features such as volume/mute settings for the Video Player. Because these technologies are similar to browser cookies, they are sometimes called “browser cookies,” even though they may be stored in different parts of your computer.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. For information about disabling cookies or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click <a href="//helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" alt="Manage, disable Local Shared Objects | Flash Player" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note that disabling cookies or deleting information contained in cookies or Flash cookies may interfere with the performance and features of the Hulu Services, including not being able to store your preferences or login information.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <i>Web Beacons, Pixels and mobile SDKs.</i> In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, to collect certain types of information from your browser or device, check whether you have viewed a particular web page, ad, or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Content, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Content was viewed. We may also use or work with third parties including our business partners and service providers who use mobile Software Development Kits (“SDKs”) to collect information, such as advertising identifiers (e.g., “ad-ID” or “IDFA”) and information related to how mobile devices interact with the Hulu Services.
        </p>  
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The use of these various technologies in connection with advertising on the Hulu Services is explained further below. To learn about opting out of interest-based or online behavioral advertising, please see the information we have provided in <a href="#YourChoices" alt="Section 6: Your Controls and Choices, Including Opt-Out Options">Section 6 (“Your Controls and Choices, Including Opt-Out Options”)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Account and Profile Data from Third-Party Services.</span> If you choose to log-in, access or otherwise connect to the Hulu Services, or contact Hulu through a third-party service, we may, for example, collect identifiers including your user ID and user name associated with that service, as well as any information you make public using that service. We may also collect information you have authorized the service to share with us (such as your user ID, billing information, public profile information, email address, birthday, pages you have “liked” and other account and profile data).
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Information from Partners and Other Sources.</span> We collect information from companies through which you may access or interact with the Hulu Services (e.g., distribution partners, including device partners and voice assistant platforms) or through which you pay for the Hulu Services or otherwise receive access to the Hulu Services as part of your relationship with such company (e.g., mobile phone carriers or other companies that provide services to you). The information we collect from these partners may include email address and other identifiers that support authentication, activation, and personalization of the Hulu Services, as well as payment processing and other billing-related matters. We may also collect information about you from other sources, including service providers (e.g., data licensors, research and analytics companies, and payment processors), public databases, our marketing partners, and advertisers. This may include information (whether identifiable, de-identified or anonymous, and whether collected online or offline) about your interests, demographic data, purchasing behavior, and your activities online (such as websites visited and advertisements viewed).
    </p>
    <p>
      We may use the information we collect from or about you to better understand your preferences and behaviors, including to customize Content and advertising for you.  We may combine the information we collect from or about you and use it in the manner described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by law.

    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Use of Aggregate or De-Identified Information.</span> In addition to the individual data use described in this Privacy Policy, we may aggregate information about you and other individuals together, or otherwise “de-identify” the information about you (which means that the information does not directly or indirectly identify you). We may use information in these forms for any legitimate business purpose, including for research and analysis, administration of the Hulu Services, advertising (e.g., improving our targeting efforts), and promotional purposes.

      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Audience Measurement Providers.</span> Our business partners, such as content programmers, as well as our advertisers, seek to measure the performance of their creative material across many platforms, including the Hulu Services. Accordingly, Hulu may permit the use of third-party measurement software that enables third parties (such as Nielsen) to use information collected from or about you (e.g., Viewing Information, ad exposure data, IP address, advertising identifiers) to include your viewing on the Hulu Services in calculating measurement statistics such as TV Ratings. To learn more about your choices with respect to Nielsen measurement software, please see the information we have provided in <a href="#YourChoices" alt="Section 6: Your Controls and Choices, Including Opt-Out Options">Section 6 (“Your Controls and Choices, Including Opt-Out Options”)</a>.

      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Advertisers.</span> We display advertisements from other companies on the Hulu Services, often enabling users to interact with the advertisements or click through to websites or other properties owned or operated by other companies. These advertisers and their service providers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information, from or about you through the Hulu Services in order to tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness, and enable other enhancements. This information may relate to your use of the Hulu Services, websites you visited, advertisements you viewed, and your other activities online and may include the information described in <a href="#InfoWeCollect" alt="Section 2: Info we Collect">Section 2 (“Information We Collect”)</a>. We may also compile and provide reports, including in encrypted, aggregated, or de-identified forms, to advertisers about the effectiveness of their campaigns.

    <p>
      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Third Parties When Required By Law or When Necessary to Protect Your or Our Rights.</span> In some instances, we may disclose information from or about you without providing you a choice. For example, we may disclose your information in the following ways: to protect the legal rights of Hulu and our affiliates or partners; to protect the safety and security of users of the Hulu Services or third parties; to enforce our Terms of Use; to protect against fraud; and to comply with or respond to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity, whether or not legally required.

      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Third Parties in Connection with Certain Transactions.</span> If we sell all or part of our business, make a transfer of assets, or otherwise might be involved in a change of control transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer information from or about you to one or more third parties as part of the transaction, including the due diligence process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Parties with Your Consent or When You Otherwise Choose to Share.</span> We may also share information from or about you with any party when we have your consent or when you otherwise choose to share such information.

        <p>
          Advertising that is based on information collected from or about you across websites, applications and other platforms over time is known as online behavioral or interest-based advertising. Some of the third parties (e.g., ad networks and partners; data exchanges; marketing analytics, digital advertising and marketing service providers) that collect information from or about you on the Hulu Services in order to provide more relevant advertising to you participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and/or may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”).

This Privacy Policy explains the collection, use, and sharing of information from or about you, including personal information, in connection with your use of the Hulu Services. The term “Hulu Services” refers to our video service, including the selection of television shows, clips, movies, and other content we offer (collectively, the “Content”) and our player for viewing the Content (the “Video Player”), as well as any other products, features, tools, materials, or other services offered from time to time by Hulu through a variety of Access Points. The term “Access Points” refers to, collectively, the hulu.com website (the “Hulu Site”), applications, and other places through which the Hulu Services may be accessed, including websites and applications of Hulu’s third-party distribution partners and other websites where users or website operators are permitted to embed or have otherwise licensed the Video Player. The information practices of third-party Access Points are governed by their own privacy policies and are not governed by this Privacy Policy; accordingly, we recommend you review the privacy policies of these third parties. Please also note that the Hulu Services may contain links to other sites owned or operated by other companies, including our advertisers, and Hulu does not notify you when you have chosen to click through to another website or property when using the Hulu Services. We recommend that you review the privacy policies of such other websites or properties.\r\n    \u003c/p\u003e\r\n    \u003cp\u003e\r\n      By viewing any Content or otherwise using the Hulu Services, whether you are a subscriber, other registered user, or a visitor who has not subscribed to or registered for the Hulu Services, you consent to the collection and use of information from or about you as explained in this Privacy Policy. \u003cstrong\u003eIf you do not consent to the collection and use of information from or about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, then you may not use the Hulu Services.\u003c/strong\u003e\r\n    \u003c/p\u003e\r\n    \u003cp\u003e\r\n      Please note that the website addresses (i.e., URLs) included within this Privacy Policy may not function as hyperlinks on all the Access Points.

In addition, Hulu may collect similar information you provide to us when you respond to surveys or interactive ad units, contact Hulu through customer service or communicate with us by other means, or participate in promotions or events. We may also collect information you provide as part of selecting your preferences, including within your account settings, and commercial information, such as the Hulu plan(s) you purchase.
