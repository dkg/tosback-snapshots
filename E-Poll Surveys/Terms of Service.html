                                employ cookies in certain areas of the Site to allow us to
                                provide information to make your online experience more
                                convenient. For example, when you return to the Site after

                                tailoring content to you. Cookies may also be used to keep track
                                of your login name and password. While E-Poll may use cookies to
                                track your visit to the Site, this information does not identify

                            <p>Cookies are also used and are necessary to track whether a
                                user has participated in a particular poll in order to track
                                points and to prevent ballot stuffing. You may still access the
                                Site if you set your browser not to accept cookies, however, if
                                the user chooses to set their browser to reject cookies, they
                                will not be able to receive any points for taking polls and
                                would not be eligible for prizes.</p>

                            <p>(F) Like most standard websites we use log files which

                                includes your Internet Protocol address, your browser type and
                                version, the search engine you used to find the Site, if any,
                                which aspects of the Site you use and from where, and when and
                                how long you use them. We use this information to monitor and
                                analyze how users use the Site, to provide customer service and
                                to maintain and improve the Site. We may also collect similar

                                track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by
                                recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting
                                and improvement of the Site.</p>

                            <p>(L) Do Not Track: In compliance with California
                                legislation, AB370, effective January 1, 2014, E-Poll's
                                practices in responding to "do not track" signals and collecting
                                user information over time and across a network of websites when
                                you visit the Site are as follows: E-Poll does not collect user
                                information about your online activities over time and across
                                different websites and therefore does not respond to "do not
                                track" signals.</p>

                            <p>(M) Other Sites: Through the Site, you may be able to link
                                to websites, products and services owned and controlled by third

                                party and not to E-Poll to enforce your rights in relation
                                thereto. When you have clicked on a third-party logo or URL
                                displayed on the Site which links you to any Third-Party

                                follows: (i) the appearance, position and other aspects of the
                                link may not be such as to damage or dilute the goodwill
                                associated with E-Poll's and/or its licensors' names and
                                trademarks; (ii) the appearance, position and other attributes
                                of the link may not create the false appearance that your
                                organization or entity is sponsored by, affiliated with, or
                                associated with E-Poll; and (iii) when selected by a user, the
                                link must display the E-Poll Site on full-screen and not within

                                resolution of the matter directly between the parties. You agree
                                that if the matter remains unresolved for forty-five (45) days

                                that a dispute exists, all parties shall join in mediation
                                services in Los Angeles, California with a mutually agreed
                                mediator in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Should you file

                                without first having attempted to resolve the matter by
                                mediation, then you agree that you will not be entitled to
                                recover attorneys' fees, even if you would otherwise be entitled
                                to them.</p>

                            <p>(A) Certain Definitions. "Guest" means each person who
                                visits the site and/or becomes a "Member". "Member" means each

                                which registration is required or requested. This ToU will apply
                                to both Members and Guests, hereafter collectively referred to
                                as "Guest," unless otherwise noted.</p>

                            <p>(B) General. E-Poll shall have the right at any time to
                                change or discontinue any aspect or feature of the Service,

                                of availability, registration requirements and equipment needed
                                for access or use.</p>

                            <p>(C) Changed Terms. E-Poll shall have the right at any time
                                to impose, change or modify its other terms and conditions
                                applicable to use of the Service, or any part thereof, or to
                                impose new terms and conditions. Such changes, modifications,
                                additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon
                                notice thereof, which may be given by any reasonable means
                                including, but not limited to, posting on the Service a revised

                                site and email. Any use of the Service by a Guest or Member
                                after such notice (other than to terminate such Member's
                                account) shall conclusively be deemed to constitute acceptance
                                by such Guest or Member of such changes, modifications,
                                additions or deletions. Each Guest or Member agrees to review
                                the terms and conditions periodically to be aware of such
                                revisions.</p>

                            <p>(D) Provision of the Service. You are responsible for any
                                Internet connection and telecommunications fees and charges that
                                you incur when accessing the Service. You acknowledge and agree
                                that E-Poll may make changes to the E-Poll Site or Service at
                                any time without notifying you in advance.</p>

                            <p>(E) Termination of Service. E-Poll reserves the right to
                                deny service to any person or entity at E-Poll's sole and

                                stop providing the Service or restrict your use of the Service
                                at any time, without notifying you in advance, for any reason or
                                no reason, including, without limitation, for any violation of
                                this ToU and/or if E-Poll suspects that you have used any aspect
                                of the Service to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity. If
                                E-Poll disables your access to your account, you may be
                                prevented from accessing the Service, your account details
                                and/or any materials contained in your account.</p>

                                important. You are solely responsible for maintaining the
                                confidentiality of your account password. You agree to notify
                                E-Poll immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use
                                of your password or of your account.</p>

                                E-Poll immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use
                                of your password or of your account.</p>

                                (C) Cancellation by You. You have the right to cancel your
                                account at any time. You may cancel your account by notifying
                                E-Poll by email at <a

                                terminate your account if:
                            <ul style="list-style: none">
                                <li>i. E-Poll determines that you are (a) in breach of or
                                    otherwise acting inconsistently with this ToU or the Company's
                                    Privacy Policy or (b) engaging in fraudulent or illegal
                                    activities or other conduct that may result in liability to
                                    E-Poll;
                                </li>
                                <li>ii. E-Poll determines it is required by law to
                                    terminate your account; or
                                </li>

                                    critical portions of the Service in the country where you
                                    reside, or E-Poll determines that it is no longer in its
                                    business interests to continue providing the Service or
                                    critical portions of the Service.
                                </li>

                            Members who have not completed at least one survey in any
                            continuous 12-month period will be deemed inactive and all points
                            accumulated by that member will be forfeited. In addition, the
                            member's account may be subject to termination.
                            </p>
                            <p>(E) Effect of Account Termination. If you voluntarily
                                terminate your account or allow your account to lapse, you will
                                be able to reactivate that account at any time through the
                                account interface on the E-Poll Site. Accounts terminated by
                                E-Poll for any type of abuse including, without limitation, a
                                violation of this ToU, may not be reactivated for any reason. In
                                the event of termination by either party, all points accumulated
                                and not redeemed as of the time of termination will be
                                forfeited.</p>

                                . You and E-Poll agree that, except as provided in Section 19(D)
                                below, all disputes, controversies and claims related to this
                                ToU (each a "Claim"), shall be finally and exclusively resolved
                                by binding arbitration, which may be initiated by either party
                                by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other
                                party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and
                                binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under
                                the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that
                                are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the
                                "JAMS Rules") and under the terms set forth in this ToU. In the
                                event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section
                                19 and the JAMS Rules, the terms in this Section 19 will control
                                and prevail.
                            </p>
                            <p>Except as otherwise set forth in Section 19(D), you may
                                seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local
                                laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both
                                you and E-Poll will have the opportunity for discovery of
                                non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The
                                arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator's
                                decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the
                                arbitrator's findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator's
                                decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is
                                subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal
                                Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an
                                arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this ToU, (a) you
                                and E-Poll may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay
                                proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or
                                enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (b)
                                the arbitrator's decision shall be final, binding on all parties
                                and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided
                                that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to
                                follow applicable law.</p>

                            <p>

                                . The arbitration will take place in Los Angeles, California,
                                unless the parties agree to video, phone or internet connection
                                appearances.

                                . You and E-Poll agree that any arbitration shall be limited to
                                the Claim between E-Poll and you individually. YOU AND E-POLL
                                AGREE THAT (a) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO
                                BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION

                                WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.

                                . You and E-Poll agree that the following Claims are not subject
                                to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding
                                arbitration: (a) any Claim seeking to enforce or protect, or
                                concerning the validity of, any of your or E-Poll's intellectual
                                property rights; (b) any Claim related to, or arising from,
                                allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or
                                unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for equitable relief. In
                                addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual
                                action in small claims court for Claims that are within the
                                scope of such court's jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.

                                . If you initiate arbitration for a Claim, you will need to pay
                                the JAMS arbitration initiation fee. If we are initiating
                                arbitration for a Claim, we will pay all costs charged by JAMS
                                for initiating the arbitration. All other fees and costs of the
                                arbitration will be charged pursuant to the JAMS Rules.

                                . You and E-Poll agree that if any portion of this Section 19 is
                                found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section
                                1(D)), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the
                                section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 19(D)
                                is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor
                                Starship will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that
                                portion of Section 19(D) found to be illegal or unenforceable
                                and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of
                                competent jurisdiction within the County of Los Angeles,
                                California, United States of America, and you and Starship agree

                                damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to
