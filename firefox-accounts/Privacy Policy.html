We strive to collect only what we need to improve Firefox for everyone.</p> <p>In this Privacy Notice, we explain what data Firefox shares and point you to settings to share even less. We also adhere to the practices outlined in the Mozilla <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/ >privacy policy</a> for how we receive, handle and share information we collect from Firefox.</p> <h2>Firefox by default shares data to:</h2> <h3>Improve performance and stability for users everywhere {: #health-report }</h3> <ul> <li><p><strong>Interaction data</strong>: Firefox sends data about your interactions with Firefox to us (such as number of open tabs and windows; number of webpages visited; number and type of installed Firefox Add-ons; and session length) and Firefox features offered by Mozilla or our partners (such as interaction with Firefox search features and search partner referrals).</p></li> <li><p><strong>Technical data</strong>: Firefox sends data about your Firefox version and language; device operating system and hardware configuration; memory, basic information about crashes and errors; outcome of automated processes like updates, safebrowsing, and activation to us. When Firefox sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs.</p></li> </ul> <p>Read the telemetry documentation for <a href=https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/index.html>Desktop</a>, <a href=https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/mobile/android/index.html>Android</a>, or <a href=https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/firefox-ios/wiki/Telemetry>iOS</a> or learn how to opt-out of this data collection on <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/share-data-mozilla-help-improve-firefox?redirectlocale=en-US&amp;redirectslug=send-performance-data-improve-firefox">Desktop</a> and <a href=https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/send-usage-data-firefox-mobile-browsers>Mobile</a>.<br> {: #telemetry }</p> <h3>Set a default search provider {: #defaultsearch }</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Location data</strong>: When you first use Firefox, it uses your IP address to set your default search provider based on your country. <a href=https://support.mozilla.org/kb/change-your-default-search-settings-firefox>Learn more</a>.</li> </ul> <h3>Suggest relevant content</h3> <p>Firefox displays content, such as “Snippets” (messages from Mozilla), Add-on Recommendations, Top Sites (websites suggested by Mozilla for first-time Firefox users), and Pocket Recommendations (which is part of the Mozilla family).</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Location data</strong>: Firefox uses your IP address to suggest relevant content based on your country and state.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Technical &amp; Interaction data</strong>: Firefox sends us data such as the position, size and placement of content we suggest, as well as basic data about your interactions with Firefox’s suggested content. This includes the number of times suggested content is displayed or clicked.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Webpage data for Snippets</strong>: When you choose to click on a Snippet link, we may receive data about the link you followed. This information is not associated with any other information about you. <a href=https://abouthome-snippets-service.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data_collection.html>Learn more</a>.<br> {: #snippets }</p></li> <li><p><strong>Webpage, Language, and Location data for Pocket Recommendations</strong>: We recommend content to you based on your browsing history, language, and country location. The process of deciding which stories you should see based on your browsing history happens locally in your copy of Firefox, and neither Mozilla nor Pocket receives a copy of your browsing history. To help you see relevant Pocket Recommendations based on your location, Firefox shares your language and country location with Pocket.</p> <p>Mozilla and Pocket receive aggregated data about the recommendations you see and click. We also share aggregated data about the sponsored content you see and click with our third-party ad platform Adzerk so advertisers can see how many people click on their articles. This aggregated data does not identify you personally.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Location data and Interaction data for Top Sites</strong>: When you click the Amazon.com Top Site tile on New Tab, we share your country and the time you clicked with Amazon and AdMarketplace (a third-party referral platform) to verify you navigated to Amazon. Firefox does not share your IP address or any other information that could be used to identify you with either Amazon or AdMarketplace.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Add-on and Feature Recommendations</strong>: We recommend Add-ons in two places: the Manage Your Extensions Page (about:addons) and the Awesome Bar, where you search or type in URLs. We may also recommend Firefox Features in the Awesome Bar. We base the recommendations in about:addons on a cookie. We base the recommendations in the Awesome Bar on your interaction with Firefox. Mozilla does not receive your browser history. The process happens locally in your own computer’s copy of Firefox.

This provides added protection from privacy leaks to local networks and also from certain DNS security attacks. System logs of your DNS requests are deleted from the service within 24 hours and are only used for the purpose of DNS resolution. <a href=https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-dns-over-https#w_switching-providers>Learn more</a> or see our default DNS resolver service providers below:</p> <ul> <li><a href=https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/firefox/ ><strong>Cloudflare</strong></a></li> <li><a href=https://nextdns.io/privacy><strong>NextDNS</strong></a></li> <li><a href=https://www.xfinity.com/privacy/policy/dns><strong>Comcast</strong></a></li> </ul> <p><strong>Technical data for updates</strong>: Desktop versions of Firefox check for browser updates by persistently connecting to Mozilla servers. Your Firefox version, language, and device operating system are used to apply the correct updates. Mobile versions of Firefox may connect to another service if you used one to download and install Firefox. <a href=https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-stop-firefox-automatically-making-connections#w_auto-update-checking>Learn more</a>.<br> {: #auto-updates }</p> <p><strong>Technical data for add-ons blocklist</strong>: Firefox for Desktop and Android periodically connect to Mozilla to protect you and others from malicious add-ons. Your Firefox version and language, device operating system, and list of installed add-ons are needed to apply and update the add-ons blocklist. <a href=https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-stop-firefox-making-automatic-connections>Learn more</a>.</p> <p><strong>Webpage and technical data to Google’s SafeBrowsing service</strong>: To help protect you from malicious downloads, Firefox sends basic information about unrecognized downloads to Google's SafeBrowsing Service, including the filename and the URL it was downloaded from.<a href=https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-does-phishing-and-malware-protection-work>Learn more</a> or read <a href=https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ >Google’s Privacy Policy</a>. Opting out prevents Firefox from warning you of potentially illegitimate or malicious websites or downloaded files.</p> <p><strong>Webpage and technical data to Certificate Authorities</strong>: When you visit a secure website (usually identified with a URL starting with &quot;HTTPS&quot;), Firefox validates the website's <a href=https://support.mozilla.org/kb/secure-website-certificate>certificate</a>. This may involve Firefox sending certain information about the website to the Certificate Authority identified by that website. Opting out increases the risk of your private information being intercepted. <a href=https://support.mozilla.org/kb/advanced-settings-browsing-network-updates-encryption#w_certificates-tab>Learn more</a>.</p> <h3>Crash reports {: #crash-reporter }</h3> <p>By default on desktop versions of Firefox, we will ask you to share a report with more detailed information about crashes with Mozilla, but you always have the choice to decline.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Sensitive data</strong>: Crash reports include a ‘dump file’ of Firefox’s memory contents at the time of the crash, which may contain data that identifies you or is otherwise sensitive to you.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Webpage data</strong>: Crash reports include the active URL at time of crash.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Technical data</strong>: Crash reports include data on why Firefox crashed and the state of device memory and execution during the crash.</p></li> </ul> <p>Read the full documentation <a href=https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/crashreporter/crashreporter/index.html>here</a>.</p> <h3>Measure and support our marketing</h3> <ul> <li><p><strong>Campaign and Referral Data</strong>: This helps Mozilla understand the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.<br> {: #referraltracking }</p> <p><em>On Desktop</em>: Firefox by default sends Mozilla HTTP data that may be included with Firefox’s installer.
