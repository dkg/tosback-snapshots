		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
					<div class="updated-date">Last updated: October 28, 2020</div>
				<p>This privacy policy describes what information Anonyome Labs, Inc. collects and how we use it within the applications, services and websites. In addition to Anonyome Labs, Inc., all subsidiaries of Anonyome Labs, Inc. also adhere to the content in this privacy policy.</p>
	</div>	
</section>

			<div class="container">
				<h2>Introduction – Take Control of Your Privacy</h2>
				<p>This Privacy Policy tells you how we (Anonyome Labs, Inc.) collect, use and share the personal information we collect from users of our websites, including <a href="https://anonyome.com">https://anonyome.com</a>, <a href="https://www.mysudo.com">https://mysudo.com</a> and <a href="https://support.mysudo.com">https://support.mysudo.com</a> (the “websites”), our mobile applications (each an “Application”) and online services (“Services”).</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>We build our apps with a single intent: Give the user control. This philosophy guides everything we do.</p>
<ul>
<li>We make every effort to not ask you for personally identifiable information, such as your legal name, phone number, email address or your phone contacts to register for our services. You should not have to give it to us to utilize our offerings, unless explicitly required by industry or government regulations.</li>
<li>We mandate that you use our applications and services in a lawful and respectful way. We refer to this as “<strong>responsible anonymity</strong>”.</li>
<li>We do collect anonymized data about how our Applications perform, which areas are more or less favored by users, and other performance-based metrics. We do this to improve our product and services and we will never sell that data to third parties. You may opt-out of this in the Application’s settings.</li>
<li>We have no way &#8211; nor any desire &#8211; to track the precise location of our users.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User Consent</strong><br />
By submitting personal information through our websites, Applications or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, you can choose to stop using our Applications and Services.</p>
<p><strong>A Note to Users Outside of the United States</strong><br />
If you are a non-U.S. user of our websites, by visiting the websites and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be processed for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. In addition, your personal information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal information may be less stringent than the laws in your country. By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.</p>
<p>Anonyome Labs, Inc. complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. Anonyome’s Privacy Shield statement is available <a href="https://anonyome.com/privacy-shield-statement/">here</a>.</p>

				<h2>The Information We Collect</h2>
				<p><strong>Applications and Services</strong><br />
When you use an Application, we will collect the information that you voluntarily provide to us. For example, when you contact us via email, you are providing an email address and email content, and we use this information in order to communicate with you.</p>
<p>The virtual cards capability (“Virtual Cards”) offered in our Applications requires by law that we verify your legal identity before you can use the capability. In this case, you may be required to provide your name, address, date of birth and government issued identification document, as well as information about a funding source for virtual card transactions, such as your credit card, bank account and billing details. Your legal identity is associated with your Application account if you use the virtual cards capability.</p>
<p>As is typical of most online services, we automatically collect certain technical data and information that we use to provide and make our Services better. When your Application instance accesses our Services, we store certain information about your requests including date/time, type of request (e.g. send SMS), application version and IP address. We use this information to ensure the integrity and security of our services. This information does not allow Anonyome Labs to associate requests with existing mobile subscriber information including name and address.</p>
<p>We collect non-personally identifying information about your Application download such as date/time, application store region and application version. We use this information to make our Services better. This information does not allow Anonyome Labs to associate a download with a mobile platform user, e.g. an Apple ID or Google account.</p>
<p>If enabled in the privacy settings of our Applications, we collect non-personally identifying information about how users use our Application and Services, in order to improve them. We use Amazon Web Services Pinpoint and Braze for this purpose.</p>
<p>Information you provide is stored in systems located in the United States. This is the case for both Anonyome controlled systems as well as those of the third-party services mentioned above. We retain this information in the Service for a limited period to maintain our quality of service and handle support requests. You may read more about data retention in this article: <a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006599413-How-long-do-you-store-information-">https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006599413-How-long-do-you-store-information-</a></p>
<p>If you choose to accept Push Notifications from our Applications, we store a unique identifier that is only for the purpose of sending notifications via Apple (iOS) or Google (Android) to our Applications on your device, and doesn’t allow Anonyome Labs to identify your mobile device’s serial number, phone number or information regarding your Apple ID or Google account.</p>
<p>Anonyome Labs neither retrieves nor processes information about your Application identities from sites or services external to the Applications and Services.</p>
<p><strong>Websites</strong><br />
When you access our websites, we store certain information that is provided automatically as part of your Web browser accessing a website. This information includes data/time, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, browser type and browser language/locale. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the websites and to better tailor our websites to our users’ needs.</p>
<p>We use technology to protect our web sites from spam and other forms of abuse. This does not allow us to know the identity of who is accessing our web sites.</p>
<p>The MySudo Support Site (<a href="https://support.mysudo.com">https://support.mysudo.com</a>) is hosted on the Zendesk platform. If you choose to participate in the Community feature of this site, you are required to create an account in order to post messages. Creating an account requires that you provide an email address. This email address is not used by Anonyome to contact community users directly.</p>

				<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
				<p>The purpose of our Applications and Services is to allow users control of their information so they can decide and control if and when to share their information with others. Generally, it is up to you how your information is shared, what information is shared, and with whom.</p>
<p>We use your personal information to: (a) provide you the Services that you request; (b) improve the quality of experience you receive when you interact with our websites, Applications and Services; (c) send you administrative email notifications, such as security, support and maintenance advisories; and (d) respond to your inquiries.</p>
<p>When you use the Applications and Services, we will share your Sudo information with those third parties designated by you in order to facilitate the services you are using. For example, if you send an email from a Sudo, your Sudo email address is sent to the receiving email server as part of delivering the email.</p>
<p>We may disclose information if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary a) to comply with relevant laws and lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; b) to protect the rights and property of Anonyome Labs, Inc. and/or c) to protect users of the websites, Services and Applications. We refer to this as “<strong>anonymity with recourse</strong>”.</p>
<p>If you chose to provide your legal identity information in order to use Virtual Cards, we use that information to verify your legal identity. This requires that we share that information with a third-party service provider, IDology, to perform the identity verification. We will share your legal identity information with law enforcement agencies in response to a proper and lawful request, such as a subpoena or search warrant. We will not use your legal identity information to communicate with you, nor will we ever sell that information to a third party.</p>
<p>When you authorize use of your existing credit card or bank account as a funding source for your virtual cards, information is sent from your device to our payment processors as evidence of your agreement to debit your funding source. That information includes your credit card number, credit card billing address, credit card expiration date, IP address and mobile device user agent at the time you provide your authorization.</p>
<p>It may be necessary for us to share some of your personal data with a merchant if you open a dispute for a virtual card transaction. In these cases, we only share what is necessary to resolve the dispute.</p>

			<div class="container">
				<h2>Your Choices Regarding Your Information</h2>
				<p>You have several choices regarding use of information on our Services.</p>
<p>Under regulations including the European Union’s General Data Protection Directive (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), users may have certain legal rights to access certain information that Anonyome Labs, Inc holds about them and to request erasure of that information. To exercise those rights, these users may contact Anonyome Labs, Inc. at <a href="mailto:support@anonyome.com">support@anonyome.com</a> with their request. Anonyome Labs respects users who choose to exercise their rights under such regulations.</p>
<p>If you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you have the ability to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive, or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below). Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you service-related communications, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Service or Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>You can stop all collection of information by the Applications by uninstalling the Applications. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Websites</strong></p>
<p>The websites may contain links to third party websites. When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our website and go to another site, and another entity may collect personal information or anonymous data from you. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for these third-party websites or their content.</p>
