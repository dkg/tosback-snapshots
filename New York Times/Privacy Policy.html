<p><a name="2"></a><strong>2. What Do We Do With The Personal Information We Collect About You?</strong></p>
<p>We collect, use or otherwise process personal information as allowed under applicable law, including where based on one or more of the following:</p>
<p>- The consent you provide to us at the point of collection of your personal information;</p>
<p>- The performance of the contract we have with you;&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The compliance of a legal obligation to which we are subject; or</p>
<p>- The legitimate interests of The New York Times, a third party or yourself. "Legitimate interest" is a technical term under the regulation. It means that there are good reasons for the processing of your personal information and measures are taken to minimize the impact on your privacy rights and interests. "Legitimate interest" also references our use of your data in ways you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal privacy impact. We have a legitimate interest in collecting and processing personal information, for example: (1) to ensure that our networks and information are secure; (2) to administer and generally conduct business within the New York Times; and (3) to prevent fraud.</p>

<p><em><strong>B) Analysis and Development of New Products and Services.</strong> </em>We perform statistical, demographic and marketing analyses of users of the NYT Services, and their subscribing and purchasing patterns, so we can analyze or predict our users’ preferences for product and services development purposes, to determine our promotional campaign effectiveness so we can adapt our campaign to the needs and interests of our users, and to generally inform advertisers about the nature of our subscriber base. We use this information for analytical purposes, including analysis to improve customer relationships, to support strategic business decisions and our marketing tactics and to measure and track our brand health. We will engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, to comply with a legal obligation, or because we have a legitimate interest in doing so.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>C) Customizing Your Experience.</strong></em> We use the information that we have to better understand you and customize certain features of the NYT Services to provide you with an enhanced experience including to show you offerings, promotions or products that may be of interest to you, based on the demographic information, type of device you are using to access the NYT Services, your usage of the NYT Services and your reading history. We will provide personalized services because we have a legitimate interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>D) Email Newsletters and Other Marketing Activities as well as Facilitating Social Sharing.</strong></em> The New York Times will periodically send you email newsletters or promotional emails about services offered by The New York Times and its advertisers. To opt out of these emails, please see the section labeled&nbsp;<em>How do I opt out from receiving emails?</em>&nbsp;We will use the information we have about you to advertise our services to you on our NYT Services but also on other platforms. If you choose to use social-sharing functionalities, we will use your information to facilitate such action, and such action -- along with any information you share -- will be covered by the social-media platform’s privacy policy. We will engage in these activities with your consent or where we have a legitimate interest.</p>
<p><em><strong>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Administrative Purposes.</strong></em> We and our service providers use the information we have about you for the following legitimate business purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For auditing purposes, to verify that our internal processes function as intended and comply with legal, regulatory and contractual requirements;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For fraud and security monitoring purposes, including, for example, to detect and prevent cyberattacks; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To understand and assess satisfaction with our NYT Services or our customer care team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We engage in these activities to manage our contractual relationship with you, to comply with a legal obligation, or because we have a legitimate interest.</p>
<p><em><strong>F) Allowing You to Participate in Sweepstakes, Contests or Other Promotions.</strong></em> We may offer you the opportunity to participate in a sweepstakes, contest or other promotions. Some of these promotions have additional rules containing information about how we will use and disclose your personal information. We use this information to manage our contractual relationship with you.</p>
<p><em><strong>G) Aggregating and/or Anonymising Personal Information.</strong> </em>We aggregate and/or anonymize personal information so that it will no longer be considered personally identifying. We do so to generate other data for our use, which we may use and disclose for any purpose.</p>
<p><em><strong>H) User Generated Content and Public Activities.</strong></em> When you share or recommend links to content on a social-media platform (such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter), that action and any information you share will be covered by that platform’s privacy policy. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public.</p>
<p><a name="3"></a><strong>3. With Whom Do We Share The Personal Information We Gather?</strong></p>

Nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to restrict our use or sharing of aggregated or de-identified information in any way.</p>

If you are a U.S. print subscriber, we may exchange or rent your name and postal mailing address (but not your email address) and certain other information, such as when you first subscribed to The New York Times with other reputable companies that offer marketing information or products through direct mail. If you prefer that we do not share this information, you may opt out by emailing us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:privacy@nytimes.com">privacy@nytimes.com</a>, or write to us at Customer Care, P.O. Box 8041 Davenport IA 52808-8041. Please include your account number and phone number in the body of your email or letter, and include "Opt-out" in the subject line.</p>
<p>ii. We may share personal information, such as name, company and title, about attendees to our live events and conferences with sponsors; if we do, we will notify you when you provide us the information.</p>
<p>iii. We may also share personal information to third-party sponsors of sweepstakes, contests, and similar promotions and will let you know at the point of collection of your information if we do.</p>
<p>iv. We may use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the NYT Services. If you wish to make a payment through the NYT Services, your personal information will be collected by such third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
<p>v. We share in aggregate results from research surveys or panels with advertisers.</p>
<p>vi. We have a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your personal information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings). Such third parties may include, for example, an acquiring entity and its advisors.</p>
<p><em><strong>D) Compliance With Legal Process.</strong></em> We may access, preserve and disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law or we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to (1)&nbsp;comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the NYT Services; (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions); and (5) cooperate with public and government authorities (which may be outside your country of residence).</p>
<p><em><strong>E) By Using the NYT Services, You May Elect to Disclose Personal Information.</strong></em></p>

Information that we collect using these technologies is combined with personal information about you. If we combine information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information.</p>
<p><em><strong>A) Device Information.</strong></em>&nbsp;We collect information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the NYT Services, such as Internet protocol (IP) addresses (the region or general location where your computer or device is accessing the Internet), geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language and other transactional information.</p>
<p><em><strong>B) Cookies, Beacons, Local Storage and Other Similar Technologies.</strong></em> We use "cookies," Web beacons, tags and scripts, and other similar technologies including local storage objects such as HTML5. These technologies allow us to manage access to and use of the NYT Services, recognize you and provide personalization, and help us understand how people use the NYT Services. You will not be able to access certain areas of our websites, including NYTimes.com, if your computer does not accept cookies from us. Because there is no accepted standard on how to respond to “do not track” browser-based signals, we do not respond to such signals. For more detailed information about our use of cookies and local storage, and how to manage them for the applicable NYT Service, see the applicable Cookie Policy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription/dg-cookie-policy/cookie-policy.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>We transmit website usage information to third parties in order to show you advertising for The New York Times when you visit other sites. For more information about our third-party ad servers, or to learn about your choices about not having this information used to target ads to you, please <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">click here</a> (for Google), or <a href="https://www.magnolia-cms.com/legal/privacy.html">here</a> (for Magnolia).</p>
<p><em><strong>C) Analytics, Log Files and Reading History.</strong></em> As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information include IP address , browser type, operating system and other usage information about the use of the NYT Services, including a history of the pages you view.</p>
<p>We automatically combine this collected log-information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, including customized recommendations (for more information about Personalization feature, please read the <a href="https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us/articles/360003965994-Personalization">Personalization FAQ</a><u>)</u>, advertising and currency display, to improve marketing, and to track access and use of the NYT Services across the devices that you use to access the NYT Services.</p>
<p>One of the analytics service providers we use is Google Analytics. To learn more about how Google use data, visit <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners">https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners</a>. For opt-out options specific to Google Analytics, please visit <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>D) Location Information.</em></strong>&nbsp;Some of our mobile applications can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature of the app, for example, by use of satellite, cell phone tower, or WiFi signals. If you enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the app. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an app does not have that feature, the app will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information. The ads in our apps are not targeted to you based on your current GPS location, but they are targeted to you based on your ZIP code or device's IP address.</p>
<p><a name="5"></a><strong>5. Third-Party Advertising</strong></p>
<p>Some of the services and advertisements included in the NYT Services, including on NYTimes.com and within our mobile apps, are delivered or served by third-party companies, which may collect information about your use of the NYT Services.</p>
<p>These companies place or recognize cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about our NYT Services website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the NYT Services. For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device’s unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.</p>
<p>We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.</p>
<p>For example, we use Google to serve advertisements on the NYT Services, which use the Google Doubleclick cookie, and in some cases, a unique device identifier, to show you ads based on your visit to NYTimes.com and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the Google Doubleclick cookie by visiting the <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/">Google ad and content network privacy policy</a>. If you would like more information about this practice, and to learn how to opt out of it in desktop and mobile browsers on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#/">http://optout.aboutads.info/#/</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#</a>. You may download the AppChoices app at<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>&nbsp;to opt out in mobile apps.</p>
<p>Your access to our websites should not be affected if you do not accept cookies served by third parties</p>
