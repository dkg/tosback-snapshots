("Joya"), makers of the Marco Polo® video sharing app (the “Marco Polo App”) and Marco Polo Channels app (the “Channels App,” and together with the Marco Polo App, the “Apps,” use and protect the personal information of people who use the Apps or who visit Marco Polo websites such as www.marcopolo.me (the “Marco Polo Website”). We will refer to the Marco Polo App, Channels App, and Marco Polo Website collectively as the "Service" or “Marco Polo.”</p>
<h3 id="privacy-principles"><a href="#privacy-principles" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Privacy Principles</h3>
<p>Joya has two fundamental principles when it comes to personal information:</p>
<ol>
<li>We don't sell your personal information or use it to show you ads.</li>
<li>We only store the personal information that we need to operate our Service so you can communicate with the people you choose.</li>
</ol>
<p>This Policy applies to anyone who accesses the Service. By visiting the Website and/or using the Apps or Service, you acknowledge that the collection, use, and sharing of your information will take place as described in this Policy.</p>
<p>So we are clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase "Personal Information" in this Privacy Policy, we mean information that is capable of being associated with or could reasonably be linked with you, such as your name, email, or mobile number.</p>
<h3 id="what-we-collect"><a href="#what-we-collect" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>What we collect</h3>
<p>Marco Polo is a communication service. To operate the Service, we may collect Personal Information you choose to provide us.</p>
<h4 id="1-marco-polo-app"><a href="#1-marco-polo-app" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>1. Marco Polo App</h4>
<h5 id="a-basic-account-data"><a href="#a-basic-account-data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>a. Basic Account Data</h5>
<p>To create a Marco Polo account (“Account”), you provide your mobile number, your name and your email address, and may choose to provide your photo, birth day and birth month. Only other registered Marco Polo users that:</p>
<ul>
<li>already have your phone number in their phone’s address book,</li>
<li>are in a group with you, or</li>
<li>you invited to Marco Polo</li>
</ul>
<p>may see your name, photo, mobile number, email, birth day and/or birth month. Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they’ve saved and not by the name you provided to Marco Polo. For example, your spouse will still see you as “Love” when they use the app if that’s how you appear in their phone’s address book. If you chose to provide them, we collect your birth day and month so people you know get reminded when it’s your birthday.</p>
<h5 id="b-polo-messages-and-scrapbooks"><a href="#b-polo-messages-and-scrapbooks" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>b. Polo Messages and Scrapbooks</h5>
<p>Marco Polo is a cloud service. We may collect and store the content you create, including videos (or “Polos”), photos, short video clips you share with selected contacts (or “Scrapbook moments”), and text messages. We store this Personal Information on our servers so that you can access your data anytime from any of your devices that have the Marco Polo App without having to rely on third-party backups or use up your phone’s memory. Our servers are located in the United States.</p>
<h5 id="c-contacts"><a href="#c-contacts" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>c. Contacts</h5>
<p>You may choose to provide us with your friends' contact information as stored on your phone. Marco Polo uses mobile phone numbers and email addresses as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to find and communicate with other people you know. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts, and you can still use the app without giving it access to your contacts (though you will have a harder time finding people you know who also use Marco Polo).</p>
<p>We store your contacts on our servers in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts creates a Marco Polo Account and to properly display their names. We store their name, phone number(s), email address(es), and/or birth day and month for this to work.</p>
<p>Our automatic algorithms also use this data to suggest which of your contacts you might like to communicate with on Marco Polo. We use this information to suggest people to invite to join Marco Polo but we do not contact anyone in your phone’s contact list without your permission. Other than our Service Providers that we describe below, we do not share your contacts with third parties unless required to do so in response to valid legal requests, such as through a court order or search warrant.</p>
<h4 id="2-channels-app"><a href="#2-channels-app" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>2. Channels App</h4>
<p>Through Channels, you can be a leader or member of a Channels group. Leaders facilitate learning and/or provide guidance on various topics. You can subscribe to become a Channels member by joining a particular leader’s group and paying the subscription fee set by that leader.</p>
<h5 id="a-basic-account-data-1"><a href="#a-basic-account-data-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>a. Basic Account Data</h5>
<p>To create a Marco Polo Channels member account (“Account”), you provide your mobile number, your name, and your email address, and may choose to provide your photo and other social media identifiers. Channel leaders will have access to this data while you maintain an active paid membership to their channel.</p>
<p>Other Channels group members will see your name and photo, but your email and mobile number will not be shared with other Channels group members unless you explicitly choose to do so.</p>
<h5 id="b-other-data"><a href="#b-other-data" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>b. Other Data</h5>
<p>If you subscribe to a Channels group, the Channels leader and other members will also receive any other personal information you choose to share with the group.</p>
<p>To be a Channels member, you pay the subscription fee directly to the Channels leader or through Joya. If through Joya, you need to provide a valid credit card number, expiration date, CCV, and billing zipcode. This data is directly processed by Stripe and only the last four digits of the credit card number and billing zip code are made available to Joya and the group leader. Although we receive the last four digits of Channels members’ credit card number, we do not store it. Also, although Channels leaders may also see the last four digits of members’ credit card number, they are contractually obligated to not share or otherwise use that information. For more information about how Stripe will use this information, please visit Stripe’s privacy policy at <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://stripe.com/privacy-center/legal</a>.</p>
<h4 id="3-user-support"><a href="#3-user-support" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>3. User Support</h4>
<p>If you contact Marco Polo support, any Personal Information you may share with us is used only for the purposes of researching the issue and contacting you about your request.</p>
<h4 id="4-additional-technical-information"><a href="#4-additional-technical-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>4. Additional Technical Information</h4>
<p>We use third-party analytics Service Providers (as more fully described below, and including Google Analytics and amplitude.com) to automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device, and how you interact with the Service. For example, when you access the Service, we may log‎ your operating system type,‎ browser type and‎ language,‎ the pages you viewed,‎ how long you spent on a page,‎ access times,‎ Internet protocol (IP) address, your mobile device ID, mobile device serial number, unique user ID, wireless carrier, and information about your use of and actions on the Service. Marco Polo collects this additional technical data to analyze usage trends and give us more information about how people use the Service to better the user experience.</p>
<h5 id="41-cookies"><a href="#41-cookies" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>4.1 Cookies</h5>
<p>The only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Service on the web. We do not use cookies for profiling or advertising. The cookies we use are small text files that allow us to provide and customize our Service, and in doing so, provide you with a better user experience. Your browser should allow you to control these cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may choose to block cookies with your web browser and continue using the Service via the Marco Polo App and Website without interruption.</p>
<h5 id="42-web-beacons"><a href="#42-web-beacons" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>4.2 Web Beacons</h5>
<p>We may log information using digital images called web beacons on our Service or in our emails. We use web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to learn which emails are read and used by our users and which are not. We also use web beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails. Similar to cookies, we use web beacons to improve your experience with our Service.</p>
<p>Tracking Options and California Do Not Track Disclosures. You are welcome to adjust your browser or operating system settings to limit this tracking or to decline cookies and doing so will not change your experience in the Marco Polo App or Website.</p>
<p>Check the "Help" menu of your browser or operating system to learn how to change your tracking settings or cookie preferences. For example:</p>
<p>With Chrome:</p>

<p>You can manage your Personal Information in the Apps’ Settings.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-personal-information"><a href="#use-of-personal-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Use of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We use the information that we have about you to operate, provide, support, personalize, and make our Service more relevant and useful to you and others.</p>
<p><strong>No Ads</strong></p>
<p>We don't use your Personal Information for ad targeting. Marco Polo only stores the Personal Information it needs to operate the Service.</p>

<h3 id="sharing-of-personal-information"><a href="#sharing-of-personal-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Sharing of Personal Information</h3>
<p>We may share the Personal Information we collect from and about you (1) with other App users, according to your account preferences and consistent with our Terms of Service; (2) for legal, protection, and safety purposes; (3) to comply with laws and in response to lawful requests and legal processes; (4) to protect the rights and property of Joya Communications Inc., our agents, customers, and others, including by enforcing our agreements, policies, and Terms of Service; and (5) with those who need it to do work for us (our Service Providers, as defined below).</p>
<h4 id="other-marco-polo-users"><a href="#other-marco-polo-users" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Other Marco Polo Users</h4>
<p>Other users of our Service with whom you choose to communicate will be given some of your Personal Information. These other users may be located anywhere in the world, including outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Note that by entering into the Terms of Service and choosing to communicate with such other users of the Apps, you are instructing us, as part of our contract with you, to transfer your Personal Information, on your behalf, to those users in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We employ all appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security for your Personal Information that is appropriate to the risk.</p>
<p>If Marco Polo or substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, Personal Information held by us about our users will be one of the transferred assets. Such third party will be required to treat that Personal Information in a manner consistent with this Policy.</p>
<h4 id="service-providers"><a href="#service-providers" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Service Providers</h4>
<p>We work with third parties to provide some of our Service ("Service Providers"). For example, we use Third-Party SMS Providers to send a verification code to your phone number when you register on the Marco Polo App. Service Providers will have access to your Personal Information needed to perform their business functions, but may not use or share that Personal Information for purposes outside the scope of their functions related to the Service.</p>
<h4 id="our-commitment-towards-childrens-privacy"><a href="#our-commitment-towards-childrens-privacy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Our Commitment towards Children's Privacy</h4>
<p>We do not direct the Service to, nor do we knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under 13. Children under 13 are not eligible to use the Service. If we learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's Personal Information from our databases and to prevent that user from utilizing the Service.</p>
<h3 id="notification-choices"><a href="#notification-choices" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Notification Choices</h3>
<p>By default, Marco Polo sends you emails and notifications regarding activities on the Service, e.g., when you receive a Polo from one of your contacts or when a Channels group leader you subscribe to posts a new video.</p>
<p>We may also communicate with you via informational, transactional, or marketing emails and/or text messages.</p>
<p>You may choose to unsubscribe from emails by clicking “Unsubscribe” from the email or in the Marco Polo App by going to Settings and selecting the “Send me fewer emails” option or the Channels App by going to Notifications and then to Settings and unselecting whichever notifications you do not want to receive.</p>
<p>If you unsubscribe, we may still need to send you non-marketing emails about your account or our business dealings with you (e.g., emails regarding AppStore or Google Play subscriptions you have with us).</p>
<p>We may also send you text notifications. You may opt out of receiving text messages by replying to the last message received or by emailing us at privacy@marcopolo.me with your mobile number and a request to stop sending messages.</p>
<p>You may also send requests about your Personal Information to <a href="mailto:privacy@marcopolo.me?Subject=Privacy" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">privacy@marcopolo.me</a>. You can also request to change your contact choices, opt-out of our sharing with others, and update your Personal Information.</p>
<h3 id="links-to-other-sites"><a href="#links-to-other-sites" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Links to Other Sites</h3>
<p>The Service may contain links to other third-party websites or applications. For example, we allow you to forward your Polos to YouTube.com. Any information you provide on those sites is subject to that third party's privacy policy. Our Policy does not apply to such sites, and we are not responsible for the privacy and security practices and policies of those third-party sites or applications.</p>
<h3 id="security-of-your-personal-information"><a href="#security-of-your-personal-information" aria-hidden="true"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Security of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>We are committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information. We have taken certain physical, administrative, and technical steps to help safeguard the information we collect from and about you. While we take steps to help ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee our security measures.</p>
