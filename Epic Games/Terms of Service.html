&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>Accessing the Services and Account Security</strong></u></span><br />
<br />
We may withdraw or amend the Services, and any related service or content, or restrict access (including by means of cancellation, termination, or modification, or suspension of a user account) to all or certain users (including you) without notice and without liability to you in our reasonable discretion.

Reactions may be reduced by playing in a well-lit room, avoiding playing while drowsy, viewing the game from some distance or on a smaller screen, and limiting duration of use.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong></u></span><br />
<br />
The Services, including all content, features, and functionality thereof, are owned by Epic, its licensors, or other providers of such material and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.<br />

You are permitted to use the Services for your personal, non-commercial use only or legitimate business purposes related to your role as a current or prospective customer of Epic.

<br />
<span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>Billing, Payment and Epic Account Balance</strong></u></span><br />
<br />
As used in this Section, if your primary residence is in the United States of America, then the term “Epic” means Epic Games, Inc., otherwise the term “Epic” means Epic Games International S.à r.l., acting through its Swiss branch. ALL CHARGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES AND ALL FUNDS PLACED IN THE EPIC ACCOUNT BALANCE ARE PAYABLE IN ADVANCE AND ARE NOT REFUNDABLE IN WHOLE OR IN PART, REGARDLESS OF THE PAYMENT METHOD, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS OR AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW. Through the Services, Epic may make available a prepaid balance service (“Epic Account Balance”). Your Epic Account Balance may only be used to obtain certain products and services offered by Epic (excluding the Epic Store found at http://www.epicgamesstore.com). To access the Epic Account Balance you may be asked to provide registration details, including without limitation a Payment Method (defined below) and related billing address. Epic may offer you the ability to use the following payment methods to place prepaid funds into your Epic Account Balance: credit card, prepaid payment card, promotional code, or any other payment method as specified by Epic (“Payment Method”). Any promotional code provided to you by Epic for use as a Payment Method may be subject to additional terms and conditions associated with the promotion, offer, or coupon. When you provide a Payment Method to Epic for use in connection with the Epic Account Balance, you represent to Epic that you are the authorized user of the Payment Method, and you authorize Epic to charge your Payment Method for any Epic Account Balance funds or other fees incurred by you. If your use of the Epic Account Balance is subject to any sales or other taxes, then Epic may also charge you for those taxes. You are responsible for all uses of your Epic Account Balance, including all applicable taxes and all purchases made by you or anyone else using your Epic Account Balance.<br />
<br />
Within any twenty-four (24) hour period, the total amount stored in your Epic Account Balance plus the total amount spent out of your Epic Account Balance, in the aggregate, may not exceed US$2,000 or its equivalent in your local currency. Epic reserves the right to change, modify, or otherwise impose usage limits to your Epic Account Balance at any time, in its sole discretion.<br />
<br />
Epic Account Balance funds do not constitute a personal property right and have no value outside the Services. If you are refunded for an item purchased using Epic Account Balance funds, Epic will return the funds to your Epic Account Balance. Epic Account Balance funds are non-transferable to another person and do not accrue interest.<br />
<br />
Epic reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Epic Account Balance if after investigation Epic determines in its sole discretion that you misused the Epic Account Balance, conducted unauthorized Epic Account Balance transactions from another user’s Epic Account Balance, or used the Epic Account Balance to conduct any fraudulent or other illegal activity. In the event that your Epic Account Balance is terminated or suspended in accordance with these Terms for reasons other than fraudulent or other illegal activity, Epic will return your remaining Epic Account Balance less any charges, fees, or other amounts owed to Epic. Otherwise, Epic Account Balances are not refundable and are not redeemable for money or monetary value from Epic or any other person or entity. Epic Account Balances that are deemed unclaimed property may be surrendered to the applicable authority, as required by applicable law.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>Binding Individual Arbitration; No Class Actions</strong></u></span><br />
<br />
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.&nbsp; IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.<br />
Most issues can be resolved quickly and amicably by contacting Epic customer support at <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/customer-service">https://www.epicgames.com/customer-service</a>. But we understand that sometimes disputes can’t be easily resolved by customer support. This Section explains how You and Epic agree to resolve those disputes, including (where applicable) by binding, individual arbitration.<br />
Arbitration is an alternative dispute-resolution procedure that allows us to resolve issues without the formality of going to court. Any dispute between You and Epic is submitted to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) for fair and fast resolution. Arbitration is more efficient for both you and Epic.<br />
<strong>Disputes related to Epic’s End User License Agreement (“EULA”):</strong> If you have agreed to Epic’s End User License Agreement (“EULA”), “Disputes” as that term is defined in the EULA will be resolved as provided for in the EULA, including the EULA’s “Binding Individual Arbitration” section.&nbsp; The dispute resolution terms below apply to disputes arising solely under these Terms and not to products or services governed by a EULA.<br />
<strong>Disputes related to these Terms:</strong> If you have an issue related to these Terms and have not agreed to Epic’s EULA, the dispute-resolution terms below apply.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>1.&nbsp; Informal Resolution:</strong><br />
<br />
If you have an issue that our customer support can’t resolve, prior to starting arbitration You and Epic agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally to help get us to a resolution and control costs for both parties. You and Epic agree to make a good-faith effort to negotiate any dispute between us for at least 30 days (“Informal Resolution”). Those informal negotiations will start on the day You or Epic receive a written Notice of a Dispute in accordance with these Terms.<br />
You will send your Notice of Dispute to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: NOTICE OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A. Include your name, any relevant account name you use, address, how to contact you, what the problem is, and what you want Epic to do. If Epic has a dispute with You, Epic will send our Notice of Dispute to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us.<br />
If you reside in the European Union (“EU”), You may also be entitled to submit Your complaint to the European Commission’s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home2.show&amp;lng=EN">Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Platform</a>. ODR allows EU consumers to resolve disputes related to the online purchases of goods and services without going to court.<br />
If the dispute isn’t resolved within by Informal Resolution or small-claims court (below), You or Epic may start an arbitration in accordance with these Terms.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>2.&nbsp; Small Claims Court:</strong><br />
<br />
Instead of using Informal Resolution, You and Epic agree that You may sue us in small-claims court in your choice of the county where you live or Wake County, North Carolina (if you meet the requirements of small-claims court). We hope you’ll try Informal Resolution first, but you don’t have to before going to small-claims court.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Binding Individual Arbitration:</strong><br />
<br />
THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS IN THIS SECTION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY.<br />
You and Epic agree that Disputes will be settled by binding individual arbitration&nbsp;conducted by the <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">Judicial Arbitration Mediation Services, Inc</a>. (“JAMS”) subject to the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law and according to the <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules</a> and Procedures effective July 1, 2014 (the “JAMS Rules”) as modified by these Terms.<br />
This means that You and Epic agree to a dispute-resolution process where we submit any Dispute to a neutral arbitrator (not a judge or jury) that makes the final decision to resolve the Dispute.&nbsp; JAMS uses experienced professionals to arbitrate disputes, which helps You and Epic resolve any disputes fairly, but more quickly and efficiently than going to court.&nbsp; The arbitrator may award the same remedies to you individually as a court could, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.<br />
&nbsp;The arbitrator’s decision is final, except for a limited review by courts under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, and can enforced like any other court order or judgment.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.1 Disputes We Agree to Arbitrate: </strong><br />
<br />
You and Epic agree to submit all Disputes between You and Epic to individual binding arbitration. “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between You and Epic that relates to your use or attempted use of Epic’s products or services and Epic’s products and services generally, including without limitation the validity, enforceability, or scope of this Binding Individual Arbitration section.<br />
You and Epic agree to arbitrate all Disputes regardless of whether the Dispute is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.<br />
The Informal Resolution and Arbitration sections do not apply to (1) individual actions in small-claims court; (2) pursuit of enforcement actions through a government agency if the law allows; (3) a complaint or remedy under the EU&nbsp;General Data Protection Regulation; (4) an action to compel or uphold any prior arbitration decision; (5) Epic’s right to seek injunctive relief against You in a court of law to preserve the status quo while an arbitration proceeds; (6) claims of piracy, creation, distribution, or promotion of Cheats, and intellectual-property infringement, and (7) the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below.&nbsp;<br />
You and Epic agree that whether a dispute is subject to arbitration under these Terms will be determined by the arbitrator rather than a court.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.2 Arbitration Procedure: </strong><br />
<br />
To start an arbitration, review the JAMS Rules and follow the instructions for initiating an arbitration on the <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration">JAMS</a> website. The party starting an arbitration must send JAMS a “Demand for Arbitration” (available on its website), pay a filing fee, and mail a copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the opposing party. You will send a copy to Epic Games, Inc., Legal Department, ATTN: ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE, Box 254, 2474 Walnut Street, Cary, North Carolina, 27518, U.S.A. Epic will send our copy to your registered email address and any billing address You have provided us.<br />
The arbitration will be conducted by a single JAMS arbitrator selected with substantial experience in resolving intellectual-property and commercial-contract disputes. You and Epic both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language and that the arbitrator will be bound by these Terms.<br />
If an in-person hearing is required, the hearing will take place either in Wake County, North Carolina, or where You reside; you choose.<br />
The arbitrator (not a judge or jury) will resolve the Dispute. Unless You and Epic agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.&nbsp;<br />
The arbitrator may only award legal or equitable remedies that are requested by You or Epic to satisfy one of our individual claims (that the arbitrator determines are supported by credible relevant evidence).&nbsp; The arbitrator may not award relief against Epic respecting any person other than You.<br />
Any decision or award may be enforced as a final judgment by any court of competent jurisdiction or, if applicable, application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.3 Arbitration Fees and Location:</strong><br />
<br />
If You start the arbitration, you must pay the JAMS filing fee required for consumer arbitrations.<br />
In some situations, Epic will help with your fees to (hopefully) get us to a resolution quickly and fairly:<br />
If the Dispute involves $10,000 or less, Epic will pay all of the JAMS costs, including the fees you otherwise would have been required to pay.<br />
If the above doesn’t apply to You, but You demonstrate that arbitration costs will be prohibitive compared to litigation costs, Epic will pay as much of your JAMS costs as the arbitrator finds is necessary to prevent arbitration from being cost-prohibitive (as compared to the cost of litigation).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Even if Epic wins the arbitration and the applicable law or the JAMS Rules allow Epic to seek our portion of the JAMS fees from you, we won’t.<br />
The fee assistance offered above is contingent upon You bringing the arbitration claim in “good faith”. If the arbitrator finds You brought an arbitration claim against Epic for an improper purpose, frivolously, or without a sufficient pre-claim investigation into the facts or applicable law, then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS rules.&nbsp;<br />
JAMS costs do not include your Attorneys’ fees and costs and Attorneys’ fees and JAMS costs are not counted when determining how much a dispute involves.<br />
Epic won’t seek our attorneys’ fees or expenses from you in any arbitration, even if the law or the JAMS rules entitle us to do so. If you choose to be represented by an attorney, you will pay your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless the applicable law provides otherwise.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>3.4 Notice and Filing:</strong><br />
<br />
If a Dispute must be arbitrated, You or Epic must start arbitration of the Dispute within two (2) years from when the Dispute first arose.&nbsp; If applicable law requires you to bring a claim for a Dispute sooner than two years after the Dispute first arose, you must start arbitration in that earlier time period.&nbsp; Epic encourages You to tell us about a Dispute as soon as possible so we can work to resolve it. The failure to provide timely notice shall bar all claims.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.5 Continuation in Effect:</strong><br />
<br />
This Binding Individual Arbitration section survives any termination of these Terms or Epic’s provision of services to You.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.6 Future Terms Changes:</strong><br />
<br />
Although Epic may revise these Terms in its discretion, Epic does not have the right to alter these Terms to arbitrate or the rules specified herein with respect to any Dispute once that Dispute arises.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Class Action Waiver:</strong><br />
<br />
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, You and Epic agree to only bring Disputes in an individual capacity and shall not:<br />
seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (e.g., private attorney general actions); or<br />
consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit an arbitrator to do so without the express consent of all parties to these Terms and all other actions or arbitrations.<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Severability:</strong><br />
<br />
If all or any provision of this Binding Individual Arbitration agreement is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then You and Epic agree that the provision will be severed and the rest of these Terms shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included.&nbsp; The sole exception is that if the Class Action Waiver is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, You and Epic agree that it will not be severable; this entire Binding Individual Arbitration section will be void and unenforceable and any dispute will be resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of clauses specified in these Terms.&nbsp; Under no circumstances shall arbitration be conducted on a class basis without Epic’s express consent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:18px"><strong><u>Language</u></strong></span><br />
<br />
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the controlling language for these Terms is English. It is the express wish of the parties that these Terms and all related documents have been drawn up in English. Les parties déclarent qu'elles ont demandé et par les présentes confirment leur desir exprés que cette convention soit rédigee en anglais. Any translation has been provided for your convenience.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong>Waiver and Severability</strong></u></span><br />
<br />
No waiver of these Terms by Epic shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or any other term or condition, and any failure of Epic to assert a right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.<br />
<br />
If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
