<p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, or access to the Service without Colloq’s express written permission. You may not extract any data from our Website, especially by using an automated process for commercial (i.e. directly or indirectly in connection with any business, or other undertaking intended for profit) or spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Colloq users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

<strong>You undertake to use our services exclusively for legal and authorized purposes in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</strong></p>

<h2>Visitor’s Responsibilities</h2>

<p>Colloq is not able to review all User-Generated Content and therefore cannot be held liable for content that we haven’t created. We do not represent or endorse content published by others. It may therefore be possible that the Service contains harassing, offensive, violent content or harmful, destructive content like viruses or trojans. Colloq may contain content that violates copyright, laws, publicity rights of third-parties parties. If you encounter any such content please <a href="/contact">inform us immediately</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
<strong>Colloq is not responsible for content published by others and cannot be held liable for any damages caused by such content.</strong></p>

<h2>Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>

<p>Colloq’s software is hosted in Frankfurt, Germany. Emails are sent from the European Amazon AWS SES location in Ireland in order to best protect your data under European jurisdiction. We use a third-party provider to collect payments for purchases or subscriptions. You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk.</p>

<p>The service of Colloq can be enhanced by signing in to third-party services. The terms of service and privacy policy of those third-party services apply. Colloq may not be held liable for your use of any of these third-party services, including those that have a link on our Website.</p>

<p>We may suspend or terminate your account in case of infringement of the Agreements. Deleting an account terminates these Agreements, but grants us an indefinite license for content you collaborated to the service (e.g. event pages). This ensures that we can continue to provide this content beyond the termination of the Agreements.</p>

<p>However, certain provisions of these Agreements shall survive termination.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
<strong>You are responsible for the actions that are performed by the account that we provide to you.

This license does not grant Colloq the right to sell your Content or otherwise distribute it outside of our Service.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br />
<strong>You grant us a non-exclusive and royalty-free right to use the content you generated in order to operate our services.</strong></p>

<h2>Promotion</h2>

We require any promotions on any page of Colloq to not be intrusive, violent, harassing, annoying or promoting illegal products, services or activities. We don’t allow spamming or bulk-creating content or any other form of showing content that causes annoyance to our users on Colloq. We reserve the right to delete any inappropriate content once we get knowledge about the abuse and to take further action against anyone who may be responsible for the violations of our Agreements, including, but not limited to, blocking access to our Service without refund. We may also take legal action, if necessary.</p>
