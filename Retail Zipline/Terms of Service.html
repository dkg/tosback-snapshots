<div class="policy w-richtext">
<p class="">These TERMS AND CONDITIONS (the “Agreement”) govern your use of the retail field communication service provided as an online, hosted solution, which may also be provided through a mobile application, (the “Service”) offered by Retail Zipline, Inc. (“Zipline”, “we” or “us”). Specific business terms associated with your subscription to the Service will be an order form executed by the parties that reference this Agreement (“Order Form”). This Agreement governs all Order Forms; any conflicting or additional terms, conditions, or obligations are of no force or effect unless agreed to in a writing signed by the parties. This Agreement is a legally binding contract between the entity accepting it (“you” or “your” or “Client”) and Zipline and is effective as long as any Order Form remains in effect. This Agreement is applicable to (a) the Client who initially sets up the Service and other employees that are granted ownership privileges by you, (b) employees who manage and run your organization that will publish information through the Service (“Publishers”), and c) employees who consume the information published through the Service by Publishers (“Members”). This Agreement must be accepted prior to accessing or using the Service. Do not access or use the Service if you are unwilling or unable to be bound by this Agreement. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

<ol role="list">
 	<li><strong>Scope of the Services</strong>. In accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Service will be available to the Publishers and Members you authorize to use the service (collectively, “<strong>Users</strong>”). Your Users may use and have access to the Service and the associated generally published technical documentation for the Service (“<strong>Documentation</strong>”) provided such use and access is for your own internal business operations (and not for the benefit of a third party). If there are restrictions on your use of the Service, such as a limitation on the number or types of registered Users that may use the Service such restrictions will be in the applicable Order Form; you agree to use and access the Service in compliance with those restrictions. For the avoidance of doubt this Agreement only permits you to access and use the Service and you will not receive or have access to a copy of the code or software that underlies the Service (collectively the “<strong>Software</strong>”) or receive a copy of the Service itself.</li>
 	<li><strong>Support</strong>. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Zipline will endeavor to provide you with reasonable support for the Service through telephone, electronic mail or another online mechanism, in accordance with Zipline’s support offerings, which may be updated by Zipline from time to time.</li>
 	<li><strong>Updates</strong>. As our business evolves, Zipline may change this Agreement, the Services, or the Documentation. If we make a material change to the Agreement, the Services, or the Documentation we will provide you with reasonable prior notice either by emailing the email address associated with your account or by posting a notice in the Service. You can review the most current version of the Agreement at any time by visiting this page. The revised terms and conditions will become effective on the date they are posted at this page, and if you use the Service after that date, your use will constitute acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. If any change to this Agreement is not acceptable to you, your only remedy is to cancel your account and stop using the Services, which you may do by emailing <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#03707673736c717743716677626a6f796a736f6a6d662d606c6e"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a9dadcd9d9c6dbdde9dbccddc8c0c5d3c0d9c5c0c7cc87cac6c4">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Restrictions</strong>. Our reputation and the Service are important to us and we know your reputation is important to you. To that end, you agree to be a good citizen when you use the Service and not to, directly or indirectly: (a) modify, translate, copy or create derivative works based on the Service or any element of the Software, (b) create Internet “links” to or from the Service, or “frame” or “mirror” any content forming part of the Service, (c) reverse assemble, reverse compile, reverse engineer, decompile or otherwise attempt to discover the object code, source code, non-public APIs or underlying ideas or algorithms of the Service or the Software in whole or in part, except as and only to the extent this restriction is prohibited by law, (d) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time share or otherwise commercially exploit or make the Service available to any third party, other than as contemplated by this Agreement, (e) remove or obscure any Confidential or other notice contained in the Service, (f) use the Service in any way that violates any applicable federal, state, local or international law or regulation, (g) use the Service or any Software for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise for the benefit of a third party, (h) introduce any viruses, Trojan horses, worms, logic bombs or other material which is malicious or technologically harmful, (i) attempt to gain unauthorized access to, interfere with, damage or disrupt any parts of the Service, the server on which the Service is stored, or any server, computer or database connected to the Service.</li>
 	<li><strong>Permitted Use</strong>. You represent, covenant, and warrant that you will use the Service only in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Although you understand that Zipline has no obligation to monitor your use of the Service, you agree that Zipline may monitor your use of the Service and may prohibit any use it believes may be in violation of the restrictions in Section 4 or your warranties or representations hereunder. You also understand and agree that we may suspend your use and access or any User’s use and access to the Service that we reasonably believe may be in violation of this Section or Section 4.</li>
 	<li><strong>User Accounts</strong>. As part of the registration process, each User will receive a user name and password for your account. You may add new Users or change User permissions by contacting Zipline or making such changes in the Service. You will ensure that your Users are aware of and bound by obligations and restrictions consistent with this Agreement. You will (a) be responsible for ensuring the security of your account and confidentiality of all user IDs and passwords for the Service, (b) prevent unauthorized access to, or use of, the Service, (c) be fully responsible for monitoring and administrating the various uses and Users of the Service, (d) notify Zipline promptly of any unauthorized use of the Service or any breach, or attempted breach, of the security of the Service. You are responsible for all activities of your Users on the Service and are responsible for all uses of your account, whether or not you authorize such use. Zipline may access your User accounts, including relevant User Information (as defined below) (i) to respond to technical problems, (ii) in connection with providing and maintaining the Service and the development of new Service features and improvements, (iii) at your request, (iv) to comply with legal or contractual requirements, and (v) when necessary to provide the Professional Services.</li>
 	<li><strong>Your Equipment</strong>. You are responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment and ancillary services needed to connect to, access or otherwise use the Service, including, without limitation, modems, phones, hardware, servers, software, operating systems, networking, web servers and the like (collectively, “<strong>Equipment</strong>”). You are responsible for: (i) maintaining the security of the Equipment; and (ii) all uses of the Equipment, whether or not authorized by you.</li>
 	<li><strong>Professional Services</strong>. Zipline will provide implementation and deployment services (if any) as further described in an Order Form (“<strong>Professional Services</strong>”). If either party requests a change in the scope of the Professional Services, any agreed-upon changes, including changes in Fees (as defined in Section 12(a) of this Agreement) and expenses, will only be binding if set forth in a writing executed by the parties (each a “<strong>Change Order</strong>”). Absent the execution of a Change Order, the parties will proceed to fulfill their obligations under the applicable Order Form in accordance with its original terms.</li>
 	<li><strong>Zipline’s Ownership</strong>.
