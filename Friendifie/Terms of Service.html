noted updates to the Terms of Service if you're downloading our App from a third-party
App Market. As the only verified App Market for this section is the Google Play Store.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">

responsible if you download the app from somewhere else and aren't aware of any
 Terms of Service updates.
</p>
</div>
<h4 id="eligibility">3. Eligibility</h4>
<p>
Friendifie, Inc. strictly refuses access to Woopr if someone is under the age of thirteen (13),
a registered sex offender, violent or a threat (including: those who have or are being convicted
for kidnapping, murder, manslaughter, harassment, ect.) to the community as a whole. Users
who violate our Terms of Service will result in an account ban which will require an appeal. If we
think an appeal isn't acceptable we'll grant you a section <strong>10. Contract Closure</strong>
appeal. This means we'll then proceed with closing your contract and removing your content
from our servers. But, if we see your ban was due to malicious intent to violate these
Terms of Service or Policies we'll need to discuss the appeal process with you to be processed
successfully. If that's not understandable then we'll offer you a permanently IP Ban for the
contract cancellation. Read more about cancelling your contract below and we'll be happy to
assist you as soon as possible.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
<p>
If you violate our Terms of Service, your account will get banned. You will be allowed to place
and appeal for a section <strong>10. Contract Closure</strong>. If we think you've been malicious
we can ban your Device ID or IP Address(s) to stop any further abuse towards our infrastructure.
</p>
</div>
<h4>4. Account</h4>
<p>
Friendifie, Inc. reserves the right to ban any user for any reason with or without notice if the
user is expected of violating this Terms of Service or using our services in an ill-mannered method.
We still allow banned users to close their Woopr contract by emailing us via
<a href="mailto:support@friendifie.com">support@friendifie.com</a>. Set the Subject field as
<strong>Banned Contract Closure Request</strong> and we'll work as quickly as possible to close
your contract for you because your contract closing method has been revoked. For a quicker response
please email us off of the email address associated with your account for verification purposes.
If you encounter any issues in regards to your ban, we'll quickly take appropriate actions to
appeal the contract as soon as possible to quickly close your contract for you on your behalf.

in no way, shape or form responsible for any messages or photos you share with other users.

</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">

</p>
</div>
<h4>6. Appeals</h4>
<p>
Friendifie, Inc. partners who retain a valid contract with Friendifie, Inc. reserve all rights of ownership
and therefore can not be refused an appeal or contract closure. Friendifie, Inc. however does reserve the
right to blacklist abuse for future means. We take security <strong>extremely seriously</strong> and will
ban any IP Address or Device ID that constantly abuses our services. However, an IP Ban is a worst case
scenario for extreme abusers who refuse to let up on the constant abuse towards our infrastructures and
technologies. In these type of situations, we also reserve the right to pursue legal action towards the
malicious party at their expense. If anyone inside of Friendifie, Inc. refuses an acceptable appeal it will
be passed through to the appropriate security parties and the lower divisions who've failed to roll out a
means of security appeals of contract cancellations will result in objection or an appeal.
</p>
<div class="alert alert-danger">
<p>
We're cancelling your contracts no matter what, even if we have to fire someone who's not appealing your contract
appropriately. Because, we don't want your data. We want your loyal satisfaction. So, if anyone on our side tries to
stand between your security they'll meet dire consequences and will have to place an appeal. If not they'll be out of
a job because they failed to protect your security.
</p>

Due to legal reasons we must retain deleted information for a period of time, this is called "Data Retention".

made any changes we're not aware of.

<h4>10. Contract Closure</h4>
<p>

to remove your content and our permissions to your content at any moment. If you shall wish to cancel your
Friendifie, Inc.'s Contract via Woopr you're allowed to permanently delete your account under your
Account Settings which immediately closes your contract with us which renders our permissions to your
information useless. The contract holder should understand that all information has a set limit of two-weeks
before it's permanently deleted from our servers due to legal obligations. After this period all information on our
servers will be removed and hopefully all cache information will be removed ultimately erasing you forever
from the Friendifie, Inc. platform.

<p>
You own your contract and all of your information. At any moment you can permanently delete your account and we'll
remove you as soon as possible. But, due to legal reasons we must wait at least two-weeks (shortest retention period ever)
and then all your information will be removed forever. But, you should keep in mind our servers also have their own minds,
will cache data for a period of time before they expire and clear themselves out <strong>even though we tell our
servers to not cache anything, it's just how technologies work together</strong>.
