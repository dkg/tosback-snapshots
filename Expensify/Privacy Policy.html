The parties that set third party cookies can recognize your device, both when you use the Services and when you use other websites or mobile apps. You should check the third party’s website for more information about how they use cookies and other tracking technologies. Both first party and third party cookies can serve a number of different functions, such as analytics, marketing and advertising.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>B. What other similar tracking technologies does Expensify use?&nbsp;</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> In addition to cookies, web beacons may be set by us or third parties in respect of your use of the Site or Application.

Expensify will not sell or disclose usage data to any third party unless such usage data has been aggregated or de-identified and is no longer capable of identifying you as an individual.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Cookies on our Sites are generally divided into the following categories:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Strictly necessary cookies.</strong> These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website or provide necessary functions relating to the services you request. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website, use a shopping cart or make use of e-billing services.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Analytical or performance cookies.</strong> These allow us to recognize and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily. These cookies also allow us to collect statistical information about how you use the Site or App (including how long you spend on the Site or Application) and where you have come to the Site or Application from, so that we can improve the Site and learn which parts of the Site and which functions of the Application are most popular with users.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Functionality cookies.</strong> These cookies enable helpful but non-essential website functions that improve your website experience. By recognizing you when you return to our website, they may, for example, allow us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, or remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). This also enables us to customize elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Site or Application We also use functional social media plug ins, such as the Facebook “Like” button and Widgets, such as the “Share this” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set an Identifier to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the Privacy Policy of the company providing it.</p></li></ul><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Targeting cookies.</strong> These cookies enable different advertising related functions.
