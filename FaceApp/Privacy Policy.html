Individuals located in the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:European_Economic_Area_(EEA)">European Economic Area</a> should also read our Notice to European Users <a href="#notice-to-european-users">below</a>.</p><h2 id="personal-information-we-collect">Personal Information We Collect</h2><p>When you use the App, we may collect information about you, including:</p><ul><li><span class="strong">Photographs you provide when you use the App</span>, via your camera or camera roll (if you have granted us permission to access your camera or camera roll), the in-App internet search functionality, or your social media account (if you choose to connect your social media account). We obtain only the specific images you chose to modify using the App; we do not collect your photo albums even if you grant us your access to them. We encrypt each photograph that you upload using the App. The encryption key is stored locally on your device. This means that the only device that can view the photo is the device from which the photograph was uploaded using the App – the user’s device. Please note that while we do not require or request any metadata attached to the photographs you upload, metadata (including, for example, geotags) may be associated with your photographs by default. We take steps to delete any metadata that may be associated with a photograph you provide when you use the App.</li><li id="app-usage-information"><span class="strong">App usage information</span>, such as information about how you use the App and interact with us, including your preferred language, the date and time when you first installed the App and the date and time you last used the App.</li><li><span class="strong">Purchase history</span>, if you choose to purchase an App subscription, such as confirmation that you are a paid subscriber to the App.</li><li><span class="strong">Social media information</span>, if you choose to login to the App via a third-party platform or social media network (for example, Facebook), or otherwise connect your account on the third-party platform or network to the App. We may collect information from that platform or network, such as your social media alias, first and last name, number of “friends” on the social media platform and, if depending on your Facebook or other network settings, a list of your friends or connections (though we do not use or store this information). Our collection and processing of the information we obtain from social media platforms is governed by the requirements these social media platforms impose on us in their relevant terms and conditions.</li><li><span class="strong">Device data</span>, such as your computer and mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, device ID, push tokens, Google Advertising ID, Apple ID for Advertising, browser type, screen resolution, IP address (and the associated country in which you are located), the website you visited before visiting our Site; and other information about the device you are using to visit the App.</li><li><span class="strong">Online activity data</span>, such as information about your use of and actions on the App and the Sites, including pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and length of access. Our service providers and certain third parties (e.g., online advertising networks and their clients) also may collect this type of information over time and across third-party websites and mobile applications. This information may be collected on our Site using cookies, browser web storage (also known as locally stored objects, or “LSOs”), web beacons, and similar technologies. We may collect this information directly or through our use of third-party software development kits (“SDKs”). SDKs may enable third parties to collect information directly from our App.</li></ul><h2>How We Use Your Personal Information</h2><p>We do not use the photographs you provide when you use the App for any reason other than to provide you with the editing functionality of the App. We may use information other than photographs for the following purposes:</p><p class="strong" id="to-operate-and-improve-the-app">To operate and improve the App:</p><ul><li>Enable you to use the App’s features;</li><li>Establish and maintain your account, if you choose to login to the App using your social media account;</li><li>Communicate with you about the App, including by sending you announcements, updates, and security alerts, which we may send through a push notification, and responding to your requests, questions and feedback;</li><li>Provide technical support and maintenance for the App; and</li><li>Perform statistical analysis about use of the App (including throught the use of <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">Google Analytics</a>).</li></ul><p id="to-send-you-marketing-pand-promotional-communications"><span class="strong">To send you marketing and promotional communications.</span> We may send you marketing communications as permitted by law.

Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies, the Site may not work properly. Similarly, your browser settings may allow you to clear your browser web storage.</p><p><span class="strong">Targeted online advertising.</span> Some of the business partners that collect information about users’ activities on or through the Site or App may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behavior or mobile application usage for purposes of targeted advertising.</p><p>Site users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through members of the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">here</a> or the Digital Advertising Alliance by clicking <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">here</a>. App users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising in mobile apps through participating members of the Digital Advertising Alliance by installing the AppChoices mobile app, available <a href="https://www.youradchoices.com/appchoices">here</a>, and selecting the user’s choices. Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms that we linked above.</p><p>In addition, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit our, or our partners’, ability to engage in ad tracking or targeted advertising using the Google Advertising ID or Apple ID for Advertising associated with your mobile device.</p><p>If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you.

We will tell you what information you must provide to use the App by designating it as required at the time of collection or through other appropriate means.</p><p><span class="strong">Third-party platforms or social media networks.</span> If you choose to connect to the App via a third-party platform or social media network, such as by using Facebook login, you may have the ability to limit the information that we may obtain from the third-party at the time you login to the App using the third-party’s authentication service or otherwise connect your account. Subsequently, you may be able to control your settings through the third-party’s platform or service. For example, you may access and change your settings through the Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications">settings page</a> for Apps and Websites. If you withdraw our ability to access certain information from a third-party platform or social media network, that choice will not apply to information that we have already received from that third party.</p><h2>Other Sites, Mobile Applications and Services</h2><p>The App may contain links to other websites, mobile applications, and other online services operated by third parties. These links are not an endorsement of, or representation that we are affiliated with, any third party. In addition, our content may be included on web pages or in mobile applications or online services that are not associated with us. We do not control third party websites, mobile applications or online services, and we are not responsible for their actions. Other websites, mobile applications and online services follow different rules regarding the collection, use and sharing of your personal information. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites, mobile applications and online services you use.</p><h2>Security Practices</h2><p>We use commercially reasonable security practices to help keep the information collected through the App secure and take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your account (if you have an account with us). However, FaceApp cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to FaceApp or guarantee that information on the App may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed.</p><p>Please do your part to help us. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login information and device identifiers, and for controlling access to communications between you and FaceApp, at all times. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes the social media services you connect to FaceApp make to their services. We are not responsible for the functionality, privacy, or security measures of any other organization.</p><h2>Retention</h2><p>We configure Google Cloud Platform and Amazon Web Services to delete photographs, and the information associated with the photographs within 24-48 hours after the photograph was last edited using the App. This allows you to revisit the image for additional modifications during that time.</p><p>With respect to non-photograph information that we may collect, we will retain such information in a personally identifiable format only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we have set out in this Privacy Policy. You may also ask that we delete your information using the “Request cloud data removal” button as described <a href="#cloud-processing">above</a> or by <a href="#how-to-contact-us">contacting us</a>.</p><h2>Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2><p>We store the information we collect in connection with the App on Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.
