                      <p class="text-medium">Please read the following section carefully because it requires users who are U.S. residents to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with FaceApp and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us.</p>
                      <p>
                        <u>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</u> Except for small claims disputes in which you or FaceApp seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or FaceApp seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and FaceApp waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or our Services resolved in court. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <u>Arbitration Rules and Forum.</u> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to our registered agent [include name and address of registered agent here]. The arbitration will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (<span class="text-medium">âJAMSâ</span>), an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or requests for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneysâ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMSâs most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/" target="_blank">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/</a>. JAMSâs rules are also available at <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com" target="_blank">www.jamsadr.com</a> or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, FaceApp will pay them for you. In addition, we will reimburse all such JAMSâs filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conduced by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                      </p>
                      <p>You may choose to have the arbitration conduced by telephone, based on written submissions or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                      <p>
                        <u>Authority of Arbitrator.</u> The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and FaceApp. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forumâs rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <u>Waiver of Jury Trial.</u> YOU AND FACEAPP HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and FaceApp are instead electing that all disputes, claims or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited. Review.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <u>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</u> ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsectionâs limitations as to a given dispute, claim or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of California. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <u>30-Day Right to Opt-Out.</u> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to: <a href="mailto:arbitration@faceapp.com">arbitration@faceapp.com</a>, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, your username (if any), the e-mail address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
                      </p>
                      <p>You and FaceApp agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in Santa Clara County, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>
