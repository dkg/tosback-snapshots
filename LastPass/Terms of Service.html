The Service Descriptions are incorporated into these Terms. You understand that your personal data may be processed in connection with your use of our Services, software, and websites which are provided via equipment and resources located in the United States and other locations throughout the world.</li>
        <li>1.2.<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Limitations on Use.</span></strong> By using our Services, you agree on behalf of yourself, your users and your attendees, not to (i) modify, prepare derivative works of, or reverse engineer, our Services; (ii) knowingly or negligently use our Services in a way that abuses or disrupts our networks, user accounts, or the Services; (iii) transmit through the Services any harassing, indecent, obscene, fraudulent, or unlawful material; (iv) market, or resell the Services to any third party; (v) use the Services in violation of applicable laws, or regulations; (vi) use the Services to send unauthorized advertising, or spam; (vii) harvest, collect, or gather user data without their consent; or (viii) transmit through the Services any material that may infringe the intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of third parties.</li>
        <li>1.3. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Changes to Services.</span></strong> We reserve the right to enhance, upgrade, improve, or modify features of our Services as we deem appropriate and in our discretion. We will not materially reduce the core functionality (as set forth in the <a href="https://www.logmeininc.com/legal/service-descriptions">Service Descriptions</a>) or discontinue any Services unless we provide you with prior written notice. We may offer additional functionality to our standard Services or premium feature improvements for an additional cost.</li>
        <li>1.4. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Proprietary Rights and LogMeIn Marks.</span></strong> You acknowledge that we or our licensors retain all proprietary right, title and interest in the Services, our name, logo or other marks (together, the &ldquo;<strong>LogMeIn Marks</strong>&rdquo;), and any related intellectual property rights, including, without limitation, all modifications, enhancements, derivative works, and upgrades thereto.

   </li>
    <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ORDERS, FEES AND PAYMENT.</span></strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>2.1. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Orders.</span></strong> You may order Services using our then-current ordering processes (&ldquo;<strong>Order</strong>&rdquo;). All Orders are effective on the earlier of (i) the date you submit your Order, or (ii) the date on the signature block of the Order  (&ldquo;<strong>Effective Date</strong>&rdquo;). Acceptance of your Order may be subject to our verification and credit approval process. Each Order shall be treated as a separate and independent Order. A Purchase Order is required for non-credit card transactions over 25,000 USD, or equivalent, unless Customer does not require a Purchase Order as part of its purchasing process.
          <ul>
                <li>2.1.1. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">COVID-19 Emergency Kit Services.</span></strong> Any subscriptions to Services labeled as “COVID-19 Emergency Kit” are for use across your organization during the contract term listed in the Order for such subscriptions and will automatically terminate thereafter or, if you have active subscriptions for the Services being purchased, on the earlier of the contract term set forth in the Order or the expiration of your underlying paid subscription term. If you have active subscriptions for the Services being purchased, the COVID-19 Emergency Kit subscriptions are subject to your existing contract with LogMeIn and do not change the terms of any previously purchased services. You may choose to purchase any of the COVID-19 Emergency Kit subscriptions under a separate order, but you are under no obligation to do so.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
</li>
        <li>2.2. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fees and Payment.</span></strong> You agree to pay all applicable, undisputed fees for the Services on the terms set forth on the invoice. Except as set forth in Section
        3.3 below or in the Service Descriptions, any and all payments you make to us for access to the Services are final and non-refundable. You are responsible for all fees and charges imposed by your voice and data transmission providers related to your access and use of the Services. You are responsible for providing accurate and current billing, contact and payment information to us or any reseller. You agree that we may take steps to verify whether your payment method is valid, charge your payment card or bill you for all amounts due for your use of the Services, and automatically update your payment card information using software designed to do so in the event your payment card on file is no longer valid. You agree that your credit card information and related personal data may be provided to third parties for payment processing and fraud prevention purposes. We may suspend or terminate your Services if at any time we determine that your payment information is inaccurate or not current, and you are responsible for fees and overdraft charges that we may incur when we charge your card for payment. We will not agree to submit invoices via any customer procure-to-pay online portal or Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) portals. We reserve the right to update the price for Services at any time after your Initial Term, and price changes will be effective as of your next billing cycle. We will notify you of any price changes by publishing on our website, emailing, quoting or invoicing you.</li>
        <li>2.3. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sales, Promotional Offers, Coupons and Pricing.</span></strong> Sales, promotions and other special discounted pricing offers are temporary and, upon the renewal of your subscription, any such discounted pricing offers may expire. We reserve the right to discontinue or modify any coupons, credits, sales and special promotional offers in our sole discretion.</li>
        <li>2.4. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disputes; Delinquent Accounts.</span></strong> You must notify us of any fee dispute within 15 days of the invoice date, and once resolved, you agree to pay those fees within 15 days. We may, on notice to you, suspend or terminate your Services if you do not pay undisputed fees, and you agree to reimburse us for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in collecting delinquent amounts.</li>
        <li>2.5. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Taxes and Withholding.</span></strong> You are responsible for all applicable sales, services, value-added, goods and services, withholding, tariffs, Universal Services Fund (USF) fees or any other similar fees as may be applicable in the location in which the Services are being provided (if applicable to the Audio Services only) and similar taxes or fees (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>Taxes and Fees</strong>&rdquo;) imposed by any government entity or collecting agency based on the Services, except those Taxes and Fees based on our net income, or Taxes and Fees for which you have provided an exemption certificate. Additionally, if you do not satisfy your Tax and Fees obligations, you agree that you will be required to reimburse us for any Taxes and Fees paid on your behalf, and we may take steps to collect Taxes and Fees we have paid on your behalf. In all cases, you will pay the amounts due under this Agreement to us in full without any right of set-off or deduction.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">TERM AND TERMINATION.</span></strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
        <li>3.1. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Term.</span></strong> The initial term commitment for your purchase of Services will be as specified on an Order (&ldquo;<strong>Initial Term</strong>&rdquo;) and begins on the Effective Date. After the Initial Term, the Services will, unless otherwise specified in the <a href="https://www.logmeininc.com/legal/service-descriptions">Service Description</a> for a particular Service, automatically renew for additional 12-month periods (&ldquo;<strong>Renewal Terms</strong>&rdquo;), unless either party provides notice of non-renewal at least 30 days before the current term expires. You may provide notice of non-renewal for each Service you do not wish to renew at <a href="https://support.logmeininc.com/contactus">https://support.logmeininc.com/contactus</a>. We may agree to align the invoicing under multiple Orders but this will not reduce the term of any Order. Terminating specific Services does not affect the term of any other Services still in effect.
