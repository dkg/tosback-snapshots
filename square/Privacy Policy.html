<h5 id="information-we-collect-from-other-sources">Information We Collect From Other Sources</h5>

<p class="legal-callout">We also need to check that you are using our services legally, that you are eligible for the services you want to use, and we protect your data and our services from fraudsters who may put you and your money at risk. To do this, we may collect data about you from companies that help us verify your identity, do a credit check, prevent fraud or assess risk.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="customers">INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT ABOUT YOUR CUSTOMERS</h3>

<p>We also obtain information about your customers on your behalf when they transact with you. We call this information <strong>Your Customers’ Data</strong>. We collect Your Customers’ Data when they transact with you through your use of Square’s products, for instance when they make a payment at your establishment, or schedule an appointment, or receive an invoice from you. The particular Customer Data we collect will vary depending on how you use our products and services and which products and services you use. Your Customers’ Data may include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Device Information</strong>. Information about Your Customer’s device, including hardware model, operating system and version, device name, unique device identifier, mobile network information, and information about the device’s interaction with our Services.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Information</strong>. Bank account and payment card numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Identification Information</strong>. Your Customers’ name; email address; mailing address; phone number; government-issued identification; or other historical, contact, and demographic information, and signature.</li>
  <li><strong>Location Information</strong>. The location of Your Customer’s device if they pay with Apple or Android Pay.</li>

</ul>

<h5 id="information-your-customers-may-provide">Information Your Customers May Provide Square</h5>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Identification information</strong>. Your customers’ name, email address, or telephone number, which we link to a tokenized version of their payment card number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Privacy laws that apply in certain places, like California, treat “businesses” and “service providers” differently.  Under those laws, a business is the company that decides why and how to process personal information. A service provider processes personal information on behalf of a business in order to provide services. When Square processes Your Customers’ Data, we generally act as your service provider. In select cases, however, we may act as a business when we process Your Customers’ Data. For example, we act as a business when we use Your Customers’ Data to send Your Customers digital receipts directly from Square, or when we allow you to use Customer Directory or Square Marketing to contact your buyer using a masked email address (for example, j<strong>**</strong>***@gmail.com) that gets routed to them via Square. Your Customers can visit the <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/buyer-features">Privacy Notice for Square Buyer Features</a> for more information on how Square processes their data when it is acting as a business, and the <a href="https://squareup.com/legal/privacy-no-account">Privacy Notice for non-account holders</a> for more information on how Square processes their data as your service provider.</p>

<p class="legal-callout">Digital cookies and similar technologies help us make our services better to use by doing things like recognizing when you’ve signed in, analyzing how you use our services so we can make them more useful to you, giving you a more personalized experience, and making our ads to you work better.</p>

<p>When you interact with our online services, or open emails we send you, we obtain certain information using automated technologies, such as cookies, web server logs, web beacons and other technologies.  A “cookie” is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.  A “web beacon,” also known as an internet tag, pixel tag, or clear GIF, is a tiny graphic image that may be used in our websites or emails.</p>

<p>We use these automated technologies to collect your device information, internet activity information, and inferences as described above.  These technologies help us to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remember your information so you do not have to re-enter it;</li>
  <li>Track and understand how you use and interact with our online services and emails;</li>
  <li>Tailor our online services to your preferences;</li>
  <li>Measure how useful and effective our services and communications are to you; and</li>
  <li>Otherwise manage and enhance our products and services.</li>
</ul>

<p>We set some of these automated technologies ourselves, but others are set by third parties who deliver services on our behalf.  For example, we may use other companies’ web analytics services (described in the <a href="#third">“Third-Party Analytics Services”</a> section), which use automated technologies to help us evaluate how customers use our websites.</p>

<p>Your browser can alert you when cookies are placed on your device, and how you can stop or disable them via your browser settings. Please note, however, that without cookies all of the features of our online services may not work properly. If you use a mobile device, you can manage how your device and browser share certain device data by changing the privacy and security settings on your mobile device. You can learn more about cookies and how to manage your preferences by visiting <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<h4 id="third">THIRD-PARTY ANALYTICS SERVICES</h4>

<p class="legal-callout">We use other companies as service providers to help us analyze our site, track metrics, and advertise to you. These service providers generally promised us under contract to keep data private but have their own privacy policies that you should be aware of.</p>

<p>We may use third-party analytics service providers to help us with our online services, such as Google Analytics, Facebook, BugSnag and Crashlytics. The analytics providers that administer these services use technologies such as cookies, web beacons, and web server logs to help us analyze how you use our online services. We may disclose your <a href="#information-we-collect-from-your-use-of-the-services">site-use information</a> (including IP address) to these analytics providers, and other service providers who use the information to help us figure out how you and others use our online services.</p>

<h3 id="long">HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

<p class="legal-callout">We keep your information as long as you keep using our products and services. After that, we keep it for as long as we need it to do things like fight fraud, collect fees you owe, resolve disputes with (or involving) you, follow the law, enforce our agreements and defend our rights in court.</p>

<p>We generally keep your information as long as reasonably necessary to provide you the Services or to comply with applicable law. However, even after you deactivate your account, we can retain copies of information about you and any transactions or Services in which you may have participated for a period of time that is consistent with applicable law, applicable statute of limitations or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to detect or prevent fraud, to collect fees owed, to resolve disputes, to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to enforce our <a href="https://squareup.com/legal/ua">General Terms</a> or other applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with applicable law.</p>

<h3 id="choices">YOUR CHOICES</h3>

<p class="legal-callout">You can <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/privacy?preview=true#personal-information">see, change or fix</a> information you gave us, ask us to <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/privacy?preview=true#deactivating-your-account">deactivate</a> your account, control your <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/privacy?preview=true#location">location information</a>, or <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/legal/general/privacy?preview=true#promotional-communications">tell us to stop marketing to you by opting out</a>.</p>

<p class="legal-callout">If you live in California, you have additional rights, which we describe <a href="#california">below</a>.</p>

<h5 id="personal-information">Personal Information</h5>

<p>You may access, change, or correct information that you have provided by logging into your Square account at any time or by making a request to us using the <a href="#contact">contact details below</a>. We will need to verify your identity before granting access or otherwise changing or correcting your information.</p>

<h5 id="deactivating-your-account">Deactivating Your Account</h5>

<p>If you wish to deactivate your account, you can do so by logging into your Square account or by emailing us using the contact details <a href="#contact">provided below</a>.</p>

<h5 id="location">Location Information</h5>

<p>In order to provide certain Services, we may request access to location information, including precise geolocation information collected from your device. If you do not consent to the collection of this information, certain Services will not function properly and you will not be able to use those Services. You can stop our collection of location information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. If you do so, some of our mobile applications will no longer function. You also may stop our collection of location information via mobile application by following the standard uninstall process to remove all Square mobile applications from your device.</p>

<h5 id="promotional-communications">Promotional Communications</h5>

<p>You can opt out of receiving promotional messages from Square by following the instructions in those messages, by informing the caller that you would not like to receive future promotional calls, or by changing your notification settings by logging into your Square account. You may only opt out of text messages from Square by replying STOP. Opting out of receiving communications may impact your use of the Services. If you decide to opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as digital receipts and messages about your account or our ongoing business relations.</p>

<h4 id="online-behavioral">ONLINE BEHAVIORAL OR INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISING</h4>

<h5 id="third-party-online-behavioral-or-interest-based-advertising-services-on-websites-including-mobile-websites">Third-Party Online Behavioral or Interest-Based Advertising Services on Websites (including Mobile Websites)</h5>

<p>Some of the advertising platforms that we use to collect information from or about you in order to provide more relevant advertising to you on websites participate in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. This program offers a centralized location where users can make choices about the use of their information for online behavioral advertising. To make choices about the use of your information for online behavioral advertising on websites, please visit the <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&amp;lang=EN">Digital Advertising Alliance Webchoices tool</a>. If you opt out of online behavioral advertising using this method, this opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.</p>

<p>Some of the advertisers, advertising technology companies, and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), a cooperative of online marketing companies that offers a centralized tool for opting out of interest-based advertising delivered to each of its member companies. If you would like to opt out of the NAI’s members’ use of information from or about you on websites, please visit the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1">NAI’s opt-out of interest-based advertising page</a>. If you opt out of interest-based advertising using this method, this opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.</p>

<h5 id="third-party-online-behavioral-or-interest-based-advertising-services-within-mobile-applications">Third-Party Online Behavioral or Interest-Based Advertising Services Within Mobile Applications</h5>

<p>Some of the advertising platforms that we use to collect information from or about you in order to provide our advertising to you within mobile applications participate in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. This program offers a mobile application called the “AppChoices,” which provides a centralized location where you can make choices about the use of your information for online behavioral advertising within the mobile environment. The AppChoices application can be downloaded from your mobile device at <a href="https://youradchoices.com/appchoices">www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a> or from your device’s app store. If you opt out of online behavioral advertising using this method, this opt-out will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.</p>

<p>On your mobile device, you may also go to your device settings and select “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS devices), or “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android devices), which will allow you to limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device (such as precise location data) for the purposes of serving online behavioral advertising to you.</p>

<h4 id="california">RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h4>

<p><strong>Even though you use our services while acting as an employee, owner, director, officer, or contractor of a company, partnership, sole proprietor of a business, nonprofit, or government agency, if you live in</strong> California, California law gives you the right to ask if we disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes (we do not disclose your personal information for others’ direct marketing purposes).  It also gives you the right to ask if we sell your personal information to third parties (we do not sell your personal information and have not done so in the past), and if we did (which we don’t), you’d have the right to opt out of such sales.</p>

<h4 id="childrens-information">Children’s Personal Information</h4>

<p class="legal-callout">We do a lot to keep your data safe. While we think we have strong defenses in place, no one can ever guarantee that hackers won’t be able to break into our sites or steal your data while it is stored or flowing from you to us or vice versa.</p>

<p>We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your information from loss, theft, and misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Nevertheless, the internet is not a 100% secure environment, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of the transmission or storage of your information. We hold information about you both at our own premises and with the assistance of third-party service providers.</p>
