4. Description of the Services
</h2>
<strong></strong>
<p>
The Services include access to the 23andMe public website and personal
genotyping services, including the collection and analysis of your saliva
sample. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, each new feature that augments or
enhances the current Service shall be subject to the TOS. You acknowledge and
agree that the Services are provided &quot;AS-IS&quot; and are based on the current state
of the art of genetic research and technology in use by 23andMe at the time of
the purchase, viewing or other use. As research progresses and scientific knowledge and
technology evolve, 23andMe is constantly innovating in order to provide the best
possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and
nature of the Services which 23andMe provides may change from time to time
without prior notice to you. As part of this continuing innovation, you
acknowledge and agree that 23andMe may stop (permanently or temporarily)
providing some Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users
generally at 23andMe's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may
stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform
23andMe when you stop using the Services. 23andMe assumes no responsibility for the use of Services outside
the terms of this TOS or other applicable terms.

In order to use the Services, you must obtain Internet access, either directly
or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees
associated with such access. You are solely responsible for paying such fees.
In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such Internet
connection, including a computer and modem or other access device. You are
solely responsible for providing such equipment. You acknowledge and agree that
while 23andMe may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of
transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of
storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may
be set by 23andMe at any time, at 23andMe's discretion.

<h2 id="5-risks-and-considerations-regarding-23andme-services" class="h2" data-mdv-id="pub-tos-subtitle">
5. Risks and Considerations Regarding 23andMe Services
</h2>
<strong></strong>
<p>
<strong>
Once you obtain your Genetic Information, the knowledge is irrevocable.
</strong>
You should not assume that any information we may be able to provide to you,
whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome or positive. You
should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to assess the
meaning of your DNA in the context of such advances, you may need to obtain
further services from 23andMe, your physician, a genetic counselor, or other
health care provider.
</p>
<p>
We encourage you to talk to a genetic counselor, a health professional with
special training in genetic conditions, prior to collecting your sample for
testing to learn more so you can make an informed decision about whether testing
is right for you. A genetic counselor also can help you understand your results
and options.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Some people feel a little anxious about getting genetic health results.
</strong>
This is normal. If you feel very anxious, you should speak to your physician or
a genetic counselor prior to collecting your sample for testing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
You may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate.
</strong>
This information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to alter your
life and worldview. You may discover things about yourself that trouble you and
that you may not have the ability to control or change (e.g., your father is not
genetically your father, surprising facts related to your ancestry, or that
someone with your genotype may have a higher than average chance of developing a
specific condition or disease). These outcomes could have social, legal, or
economic implications.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the laboratory
process may result in errors.
</strong>
The laboratory may not be able to process your sample up to 5% of the time if
your saliva does not contain a sufficient volume of DNA, you do not provide
enough saliva, or the results from processing do not meet our standards for
accuracy.*<span id="refund" /> If the initial processing fails for any of
these reasons, 23andMe will reprocess the same sample at no charge to the user.
If the second attempt to process the same sample fails, 23andMe will offer to
send another sample collection kit to the user to collect a second sample at no charge.
If the user sends another sample
and 23andMe's attempts to process the second sample are unsuccessful, (up to
0.65% of all samples fail the second attempt at testing according to 23andMe
data obtained in 2019 for all genotype testing),* 23andMe will not send
additional sample collection kits and the user will be entitled solely and
exclusively to a complete refund of the amount paid to 23andMe, less shipping
and handling, provided the user shall not resubmit another sample through a
future purchase of the Service. If the user breaches this policy agreement and
resubmits another sample through a future purchase of the Service and processing
is not successful, 23andMe will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide
the user a refund. Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small,
unknown fraction of the data generated during the laboratory process may be
 un-interpretable or incorrect (referred to as &quot;Errors&quot;). As this possibility is
known in advance, users are not entitled to refunds where these Errors occur.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis Genetic Information from 23andMe.
</strong>
Make sure to discuss your Genetic Information with a physician or other health
care provider before you act upon the Genetic Information resulting from 23andMe
Services. For most common diseases, the genes we know about are only responsible
for a small fraction of the risk. There may be unknown genes, environmental
factors, or lifestyle choices that are far more important predictors. If your
data indicate that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a particular disease
or condition, you should not feel that you are protected. The opposite is also
true; if your data indicate you are at an elevated genetic risk for a particular
disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitively develop the disease
or condition. In either case, if you have concerns or questions about what you
learn through 23andMe, you should contact your physician or other health care
provider. Please note that genetic risk assessment is not applicable to results
of carrier screening tests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Genetic research is not comprehensive.</strong> While we measure many
hundreds of thousands of data points from your DNA, only a small percentage of
them are known to be related to human traits or health conditions. The research
community is rapidly learning more about genetics, and an important mission of
23andMe is to conduct and contribute to this research. In addition, many ethnic
groups are not included in genetic studies. Because interpretations provided in
our Service rely on these published studies, some interpretations may not apply
to you. Future scientific research may change the interpretation of your DNA.
In the future, the scientific community may show previous research to be
incomplete or inaccurate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Genetic Information you share with others could be used against your
interests.
</strong>
You should be careful about sharing your Genetic Information with others.
Currently, very few businesses or insurance companies request genetic
information, but this could change in the future. While the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act (“GINA”) was signed into law in the United States in 2008, its
protection against discrimination by employers and health insurance companies
for employment and coverage issues, respectively, has not been clearly established. In addition,
GINA does not cover life, long-term care, or disability insurance providers.
Some, but not all, states and other jurisdictions have laws that further protect individuals
with regard to their Genetic Information. You should consult a lawyer to
understand the extent of legal protection of your Genetic Information before you
share it with anybody.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Genetic Information that you choose to share with your physician or
other health care provider may become part of your medical record and through
that route be accessible to other health care providers and/or insurance
companies in the future. Genetic Information that you share with family, friends
or employers may be used against your interests. Even if you share Genetic
Information that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have
greater meaning in the future as new discoveries are made. If you are asked by
an insurance company whether you have learned Genetic Information about health
conditions and you do not disclose this to them, this may be considered to be
fraud.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
23andMe Services are for research, informational, and educational use only.
We do not provide medical advice.
</strong>
The Genetic Information provided by 23andMe is for research, informational, and
educational use only. This means two things. First, many of the genetic
discoveries that we report have not been clinically validated, and the
technology we use, which is the same technology used by the research community,
to date has not been widely used for clinical testing. Second, in order to
expand and accelerate the understanding and practical application of genetic
knowledge in health care, we invite all genotyped users to participate in
23andMe Research. Participation in such research is voluntary and based upon an
IRB-approved consent document. As a result of the current state of genetic
knowledge and understanding, our Services are for research, informational, and
educational purposes only. The Services are not intended to be used by the
customer for any diagnostic purpose and are not a substitute for professional
medical advice. You should always seek the advice of your physician or other
health care provider with any questions you may have regarding diagnosis, cure,
treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or other medical condition
or impairment or the status of your health.
</p>
<p>
23andMe does not endorse, warranty or guarantee the effectiveness of any
specific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care
providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures,
opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on our website. If we
provide to you on our website any recommendations that identify for you, based
on your Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information and scientific literature or
research, potentially actionable information, this information is intended for
informational purposes only and for discussion with your physician or other
healthcare provider. As explained on our website, 23andMe believes that (a)
genetics is only part of the picture of any individual's state of being, (b) the
state of the understanding of Genetic Information is rapidly evolving and at any
given time we only comprehend part of the picture of the role of genetics, and
(c) only a physician or other health care provider can assess your
current state of health or disease, taking into account many factors, including
in some cases your genetics as well as your current symptoms, if any. Reliance
on any information provided by 23andMe, 23andMe employees, others appearing on
our website at the invitation of 23andMe, or other visitors to our website is
solely at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
While we are licensed in the State of California as a clinical laboratory, not all
jurisdictions require our Services to be subject to license. Therefore, we are
not universally licensed by all state, federal, or international authorities for
genetic testing conducted for health and disease-related purposes. In addition,
there are certain jurisdictions in which we do not offer our Services because we
do not have the required licenses.

regulations; (b) enforce the 23andMe TOS; (c) respond to claims that any content
violates the rights of third parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or

order. You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the

28. Dispute Resolution (including Arbitration, Class Action Waiver and Time to Initiate Action)
</h2>
<strong></strong>
<p>
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Initial Dispute Resolution. We are available by email at customercare@23andme.com to address any concerns
you may have regarding your use of the Service. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner.
You agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through
consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
</li>
<li>
<p>
Agreement to Binding Arbitration. If we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of
thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to Section 28(a) above,
then either you or we may initiate binding arbitration. Except for any disputes excluded below in Section
28(d), all claims arising out of or relating to these TOS (including their formation, performance and breach),
the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding
arbitration administered on a confidential basis by JAMS, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration
Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Each party
will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense. The parties shall
select a single neutral arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures.
The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve
all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of
these TOS, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these TOS is void or voidable.
The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity.
The arbitrator’s award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions,
shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The
interpretation and enforcement of these TOS shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. The JAMS rules
governing the arbitration may be accessed at https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures. If you initiate
arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S. Dollars ($250)
and the claim is found to be non-frivolous, we will pay the additional cost. If we are required to pay the
additional cost of the filing fees, you should submit a request for payment of fees to JAMS along with your
form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS.
We will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration costs arising in connection with the arbitration,
other than costs incurred by you for legal counsel, travel and other out-of-pocket costs and expenses not constituting
fees or amounts payable to JAMS. You will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by us if you do not prevail
in arbitration. We will also pay JAMS to reimburse you for any portion of the $250 filing fee that is more than what
you would otherwise have to pay to file suit in a court of law.
</p>
<p>
You understand that, absent this mandatory provision, you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial.
You further understand that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.
</p>
</li>
<li>
Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver. You and we each further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in
our respective individual capacities only and not as a class action, and you and we each expressly waive our respective right to
file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth
in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration
provision set forth above in Section 28(b) shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not
agreed to arbitrate disputes.
</li>
<li>
Exceptions. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief (i) in a
small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction, and (ii) any disputes relating to intellectual
property rights, obligations, or any infringement claims.
</li>
<li>
30 Day Right to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set
forth in Sections 28(b) and 28(c) by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by emailing us at arbitrationoptout@23andme.com.
The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Service, or the effective date of the first set of TOS containing
an Arbitration and Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver section otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with
the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.
</li>
<li>
Term for Cause of Action. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or
related to use of the Services or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
</li>
<li>
Exclusive Venue for Litigation. To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in Section 28(b) do not apply or if you have
opted out of arbitration, you agree that any litigation shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in Santa Clara
County, California (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). You and we expressly
consent to exclusive jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California for any litigation other than small claims court actions.
In the event of litigation relating to these TOS or the Service, you agree to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by law,
any right to a jury trial, except where a jury trial waiver is not permissible under applicable law.
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="29-miscellaneous" class="h2" data-mdv-id="pub-tos-subtitle">
29. Miscellaneous
</h2>
<strong></strong>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> The TOS constitute the entire agreement
between you and 23andMe and govern your use of the Services, superseding any
prior agreements between you and 23andMe on this subject. You also may be
subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use
affiliate services, third-party content, or third-party software
</li>
<li>
<strong>Waiver.</strong> The failure of 23andMe to exercise or enforce any
right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court
 should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in
the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and
effect.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Admissibility of printed version.</strong> A printed version of this
agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in
judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this
agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other
business documents and records originally generated and maintained in
printed form.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Section titles.</strong> The section titles in the TOS are for
convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Severability Clause.</strong> If any portion of these TOS is found
to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and
effect.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or delegate any rights or
obligations under the Agreement. Any purported assignment and delegation
shall be ineffective. We may freely assign or delegate all rights and
obligations under the Agreement, fully or partially without notice to you.
We may also substitute, by way of unilateral novation, effective upon notice
to you, 23andMe for any third party that assumes our rights and obligations
under this Agreement.
