</h2>
<strong></strong>
<p>
Your use of 23andMe's Services (excluding any services provided by 23andMe under
a separate agreement) is subject to the terms of the legal agreement between you
and 23andMe set forth in these Terms of Service (<strong>&quot;TOS&quot;</strong>). Except
as specified herein, these TOS apply to any use of the Services, including but
not limited to a) submitting a saliva sample for DNA extraction and processing,

it on the 23andMe website, and/or c) creating and using a free 23andMe account
without providing your saliva sample or Genetic Information. In order to use the
Services, you must first agree to the TOS. You may not use the Services if you
do not accept the TOS. You can accept the TOS by (1) clicking to accept or agree
to the TOS, where this option is made available to you by 23andMe for any
Service; or by (2) actually using the Services. In this case, you acknowledge
and agree that 23andMe will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the
TOS from that point onwards. In addition, when using particular 23andMe
Services, you shall be subject to any guidelines or rules applicable to such
services that may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are
hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. 23andMe also may offer other
services from time to time that are governed by different terms of service.

<h2 id="4-description-of-the-services" class="h2" data-mdv-id="pub-tos-subtitle">
4. Description of the Services
</h2>
<strong></strong>
<p>
The Services include access to the 23andMe public website and personal
genotyping services, including the collection and analysis of your saliva
sample. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, each new feature that augments or
enhances the current Service shall be subject to the TOS. You acknowledge and
agree that the Services are provided &quot;AS-IS&quot; and are based on the current state
of the art of genetic research and technology in use by 23andMe at the time of
the purchase or viewing. As research progresses and scientific knowledge and
technology evolve, 23andMe is constantly innovating in order to provide the best
possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and
nature of the Services which 23andMe provides may change from time to time
without prior notice to you. As part of this continuing innovation, you
acknowledge and agree that 23andMe may stop (permanently or temporarily)
providing some Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users
generally at 23andMe's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may
stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform
23andMe when you stop using the Services unless you are requesting closure of
your account. 23andMe assumes no responsibility for the use of Services outside
the terms of this TOS or other applicable terms.
</p>
<p>
In order to use the Services, you must obtain Internet access, either directly
or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees
associated with such access. You are solely responsible for paying such fees.
In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such Internet
connection, including a computer and modem or other access device. You are
solely responsible for providing such equipment. You acknowledge and agree that
while 23andMe may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of
transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of
storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may
be set by 23andMe at any time, at 23andMe's discretion.

<h2 id="5-risks-and-considerations-regarding-23andme-services" class="h2" data-mdv-id="pub-tos-subtitle">
5. Risks and Considerations Regarding 23andMe Services
</h2>
<strong></strong>
<p>
<strong>
Once you obtain your Genetic Information, the knowledge is irrevocable.
</strong>
You should not assume that any information we may be able to provide to you,
whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome or positive. You
should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to assess the
meaning of your DNA in the context of such advances, you may need to obtain
further services from 23andMe, your physician, a genetic counselor, or other
health care provider.
</p>
<p>
We encourage you to talk to a genetic counselor, a health professional with
special training in genetic conditions, prior to collecting your sample for
testing to learn more so you can make an informed decision about whether testing
is right for you. A genetic counselor also can help you understand your results
and options.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Some people feel a little anxious about getting genetic health results.
</strong>
This is normal. If you feel very anxious, you should speak to your physician or
a genetic counselor prior to collecting your sample for testing.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
You may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate.
</strong>
This information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to alter your
life and worldview. You may discover things about yourself that trouble you and
that you may not have the ability to control or change (e.g., your father is not
genetically your father, surprising facts related to your ancestry, or that
someone with your genotype may have a higher than average chance of developing a
specific condition or disease). These outcomes could have social, legal, or
economic implications.

<p>
<strong>
The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the laboratory
process may result in errors.
</strong>
The laboratory may not be able to process your sample up to 3.0% of the time if
your saliva does not contain a sufficient volume of DNA, you do not provide
enough saliva, or the results from processing do not meet our standards for
accuracy.*<span id="refund" /> If the initial processing fails for any of
these reasons, 23andMe will reprocess the same sample at no charge to the user.
If the second attempt to process the same sample fails, 23andMe will offer to
send another kit to the user to collect a second sample at no charge.
If the user sends another sample
and 23andMe's attempts to process the second sample are unsuccessful, (up to
0.35% of all samples fail the second attempt at testing according to 23andMe
data obtained in 2014 for all genotype testing),* 23andMe will not send
additional sample collection kits and the user will be entitled solely and
exclusively to a complete refund of the amount paid to 23andMe, less shipping
and handling, provided the user shall not resubmit another sample through a
future purchase of the service. If the user breaches this policy agreement and
resubmits another sample through a future purchase of the service and processing
is not successful, 23andMe will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide
the user a refund. Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small,
unknown fraction of the data generated during the laboratory process may be
un-interpretable or incorrect (referred to as &quot;Errors&quot;). As this possibility is
known in advance, users are not entitled to refunds where these Errors occur.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis of
information from 23andMe.
</strong>
Make sure to discuss your Genetic Information with a physician or other health
care provider before you act upon the Genetic Information resulting from 23andMe
Services. For most common diseases, the genes we know about are only responsible
for a small fraction of the risk. There may be unknown genes, environmental
factors, or lifestyle choices that are far more important predictors. If your
data indicate that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a particular disease
or condition, you should not feel that you are protected. The opposite is also
true; if your data indicate you are at an elevated genetic risk for a particular
disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitively develop the disease
or condition. In either case, if you have concerns or questions about what you
learn through 23andMe, you should contact your physician or other health care
provider. Please note that genetic risk assessment is not applicable to results
of carrier screening tests.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Genetic research is not comprehensive.</strong> While we measure many
hundreds of thousands of data points from your DNA, only a small percentage of
them are known to be related to human traits or health conditions. The research
community is rapidly learning more about genetics, and an important mission of
23andMe is to conduct and contribute to this research. In addition, many ethnic
groups are not included in genetic studies. Because interpretations provided in
our service rely on these published studies, some interpretations may not apply
to you. Future scientific research may change the interpretation of your DNA.
In the future, the scientific community may show previous research to be
incomplete or inaccurate.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
Genetic Information you share with others could be used against your
interests.
</strong>
You should be careful about sharing your Genetic Information with others.
Currently, very few businesses or insurance companies request genetic
information, but this could change in the future. While the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act was signed into law in the United States in 2008, its
protection against discrimination by employers and health insurance companies
for employment and coverage issues has not been clearly established. In addition,
GINA does not cover life, long-term care, or disability insurance providers.
Some, but not all, states and other jurisdictions have laws that protect individuals
with regard to their Genetic Information. You may want to consult a lawyer to
understand the extent of legal protection of your Genetic Information before you
share it with anybody.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, Genetic Information that you choose to share with your physician or
other health care provider may become part of your medical record and through
that route be accessible to other health care providers and/or insurance
companies in the future. Genetic Information that you share with family, friends
or employers may be used against your interests. Even if you share Genetic
Information that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have
greater meaning in the future as new discoveries are made. If you are asked by
an insurance company whether you have learned Genetic Information about health
conditions and you do not disclose this to them, this may be considered to be
fraud.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
23andMe Services are for research, informational, and educational use only.
We do not provide medical advice.
</strong>
The Genetic Information provided by 23andMe is for research, informational, and
educational use only. This means two things. First, many of the genetic
discoveries that we report have not been clinically validated, and the
technology we use, which is the same technology used by the research community,
to date has not been widely used for clinical testing. Second, in order to
expand and accelerate the understanding and practical application of genetic
knowledge in health care, we invite all genotyped users to participate in
23andMe Research. Participation in such research is voluntary and based upon an
IRB-approved consent document. As a result of the current state of genetic
knowledge and understanding, our Services are for research, informational, and
educational purposes only. The Services are not intended to be used by the
customer for any diagnostic purpose and are not a substitute for professional
medical advice. You should always seek the advice of your physician or other
health care provider with any questions you may have regarding diagnosis, cure,
treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or other medical condition
or impairment or the status of your health.
</p>
<p>
23andMe does not endorse, warranty or guarantee the effectiveness of any
specific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care
providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures,
opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on our website. If we
provide to you on our website any recommendations that identify for you, based
on your Genetic and Self-Reported Information and scientific literature or
research, potentially actionable information, this information is intended for
informational purposes only and for discussion with your physician or other
healthcare provider. As explained on our website, 23andMe believes that (a)
genetics is only part of the picture of any individual's state of being, (b) the
state of the understanding of Genetic Information is rapidly evolving and at any
given time we only comprehend part of the picture of the role of genetics, and
(c) only a trained physician or other health care provider can assess your
current state of health or disease, taking into account many factors, including
in some cases your genetics as well as your current symptoms, if any. Reliance
on any information provided by 23andMe, 23andMe employees, others appearing on
our website at the invitation of 23andMe, or other visitors to our website is
solely at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
While we are licensed in California as a clinical laboratory, not all
jurisdictions require our Services to be subject to license. Therefore, we are
not universally licensed by all state, federal, or international authorities for
genetic testing conducted for health and disease-related purposes. In addition,
there are certain jurisdictions in which we do not offer our Services because we
do not have required licenses.

You acknowledge that 23andMe may establish general practices and limits
concerning use of the Services, including without limitation the maximum number
of days that Personal Information and Services content will be retained by the
Service, the maximum disk space that will be allotted on 23andMe's servers on
your behalf, and the maximum number of times (and the maximum duration for
which) you may access the Services in a given period of time. You acknowledge
and agree that 23andMe has no responsibility or liability for the deletion of or
failure to store any messages, other communications, or other content maintained
or transmitted by the Services; or for the loss of Genetic Information due to
malfunction or destruction of data servers or other catastrophic events. You

<p>
23andMe reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or
discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) with

and further develop the Services and may take the form of bug fixes, enhanced
functions, new software modules, and completely new versions. You agree to
receive such updates (and permit 23andMe to deliver these to you) as part of
your use of the Services.
</p>
<p>
You acknowledge that 23andMe may offer different or additional technologies or
features to collect and/or interpret Genetic Information in the future and that
your initial purchase of the Service does not entitle you to any different or
additional technologies or features for collection or interpretation of your
Genetic Information without fee, and that you will have to pay additional fees
in order to have your Genetic Information collected, processed, and/or
interpreted using any future or additional technologies or features.

<h2 id="18-termination" class="h2" data-mdv-id="pub-tos-subtitle">
18. Termination
</h2>
<strong></strong>
<p>
The TOS will continue to apply until terminated by either you or 23andMe as set
out in this Section.
</p>
<p>
If you want to terminate your legal agreement with 23andMe, you may do so by
notifying 23andMe at any time in writing, which will entail closing your
accounts for all of the Services that you use. Your notice should be sent, in
writing, to 23andMe's address, which is set out at the beginning of the TOS, or
online via <a href="https://customercare.23andme.com" target="customercare">
Customer Care</a>. If you provide notice online, 23andMe will send you an email
asking you to confirm your request, and your notice will be effective following
receipt of a second email confirmation from you.
</p>
<p>
23andMe may at any time, terminate its legal agreement with you (and in
conjunction therewith, your password and account(s)) if: (1) you have breached
any provision of the TOS (or have acted in manner which shows that you do not
intend to, or are unable to comply with, the provisions of the TOS); (2) 23andMe
is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services to
you is, or becomes, unlawful); (3) the partner with whom 23andMe offered the
Services to you has terminated its relationship with 23andMe or ceased to offer
the Services to you; (4) 23andMe is transitioning to no longer providing the
Services to users in the country or state in which you reside or from which you
use the Services; or (5) the provision of the Services to you by 23andMe is, in
23andMe's opinion, no longer commercially viable.
</p>
<p>
Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for
termination of your use of the Services may be referred to appropriate law
enforcement authorities. You acknowledge and agree that 23andMe shall not be
liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the
Services.

28. Miscellaneous
</h2>
<strong></strong>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> The TOS constitute the entire agreement
between you and 23andMe and govern your use of the Services, superseding any
prior agreements between you and 23andMe on this subject. You also may be
subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use
affiliate services, third-party content, or third-party software
</li>
<li>
<strong>Applicable law and arbitration.</strong> Except for any disputes
relating to intellectual property rights, obligations, or any infringement
claims, any disputes with 23andMe arising out of or relating to the
Agreement (<strong>&quot;Disputes&quot;</strong>) shall be governed by California law
regardless of your country of origin or where you access 23andMe, and
notwithstanding of any conflicts of law principles and the United Nations
Convention for the International Sale of Goods. Any Disputes shall be
resolved by final and binding arbitration under the rules and auspices of
the American Arbitration Association, to be held in San Francisco,
California, in English, with a written decision stating legal reasoning
issued by the arbitrator(s) at either party's request, and with arbitration
costs and reasonable documented attorneys' costs of both parties to be borne
by the party that ultimately loses. Either party may obtain injunctive
relief (preliminary or permanent) and orders to compel arbitration or
enforce arbitral awards in any court of competent jurisdiction.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Waiver.</strong> The failure of 23andMe to exercise or enforce any
right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
provision. If any provision of the TOS is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court
should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in
the provision, and the other provisions of the TOS remain in full force and
effect.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Term for cause of action.</strong> You agree that regardless of any
statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of
or related to use of the Services or the TOS must be filed within one (1)
year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Admissibility of printed version.</strong> A printed version of this
agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in
judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this
agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other
business documents and records originally generated and maintained in
printed form.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Section titles.</strong> The section titles in the TOS are for
convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Severability Clause.</strong> If any portion of these TOS is found
to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and
effect.
</li>
<li>
 <strong>Amendments.</strong> We reserve the right to modify, supplement or
replace the terms of the Agreement, effective upon posting at
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.23andme.com">www.23andMe.com</a> or
notifying you otherwise. If you do not want to agree to changes to the
Agreement, you can terminate the Agreement at any time per Section 18
(Termination).
</li>
<li>
<strong>Assignment:</strong> You may not assign or delegate any rights or
obligations under the Agreement. Any purported assignment and delegation
shall be ineffective. We may freely assign or delegate all rights and
obligations under the Agreement, fully or partially without notice to you.
We may also substitute, by way of unilateral novation, effective upon notice
to you, 23andMe for any third party that assumes our rights and obligations
under this Agreement.
