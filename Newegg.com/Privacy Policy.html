<p><strong style="color: inherit; font-size: 1.56em;"><span style="font-size: inherit;"><a name="Cookies and similar technologies"></a>Cookies and similar technologies</span></strong></p>
<p>We use cookies and similar technologies (including device identifiers) in relation to the Site.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-cookies" >What are cookies?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small text file that is generated by a website, including the Site, and is stored on your device. When you access the Site, a number of cookies used by Newegg and third parties are sent to your browser and stored on your device. When you next visit the Site, Newegg and the third parties will use this information to recognise and remember your device. Third parties may also use this to recognise you when you are on other websites and mobile applications.</p>
<p>Cookies are useful for a variety of purposes. For example, they allow you to navigate between pages efficiently and allow us to remember preferences and generally improve your user experience. They are also used to tailor advertising to your interests through tracking your browsing across websites. For example, when you view certain products on our Site or have interacted with certain pages on our Site, we may use this information to show you advertisements which may interest you. Similarly, third parties that place cookies on our Site may use this type of information to present you with tailored advertising when you other their websites.</p>
<p>Session cookies are deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your device after you close your browser. Cookies set by Newegg are first-party cookies. Cookies set by third parties are third-party cookies. Please note that Newegg has no access to or control over third-party technologies and information about their data collection practices should be found on their respective websites.</p>
<h3 id="what-cookies-does-newegg-use" >What cookies does Newegg use?</h3>
<p>We describe below the categories of cookies that are set by Newegg and its partners when you visit the Site.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li><strong>Strictly Necessary cookies</strong><br />These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Site and use its features and cannot be turned off. Without these cookies, services you have asked for (such as navigating between pages, placing an order and using a shopping cart or e-billing services) cannot be provided. Therefore, you cannot disable these cookies.</li>
<li><strong>Performance cookies</strong><br />We make use of performance cookies to analyse how our visitors use the Site and to monitor the Site’s performance. This allows us to provide a high quality experience by customising our offering, and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise.<br />For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages. We might also use these cookies to highlight articles or site services that we think will be of interest to you based on your usage of the Site. The information collected by these cookies is not associated with your personal data by us or by our contractors.</li>
<li><strong>Functional cookies</strong><br />These cookies are used to provide you with certain functionality on the Site. For example, to improve the performance of our services and the Site, to maintain security on the Site and to prevent and detect fraud, to customise your account, to display certain web page content based upon your browser type and other device information.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising cookies</strong><br />Subject to your cookie settings, Newegg and various third party ad partners may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect information about the browsing habits associated with your device to further personalise your experience such as through the use of targeted advertisements and special offers that are more relevant to you and your interests.<br />We allow some third parties, including Facebook to set cookies both when you visit our Site and when you use certain features on our Site (such as clicking “Like”, “Share” and “tweet” buttons). <br />These third parties link the information that they collect through the use of these cookies with the information that they hold about you through your use of their service in order to present you with targeted advertising via their platforms. For example, where you have provided permission, we allow Facebook to place a cookie on your device. When you return to Facebook, Facebook can identify you as a user of the Newegg Site and can therefore provide you with advertising messages from us.<br />In other situations, third parties use cookies so that they can retarget Newegg’s products to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications, or to predict what advertisements about third party products are likely to be of interest to you based on your browsing activities. <br />Please note that if you opt out of advertising cookies, you will still be presented with advertisements online. These advertisements will just not be tailored to you.</li>

</ul>
<li>You have the right to request that we disclose to you what information we collect, use, disclose, and sell.

You also have the right to request that a business delete any personal data about you which we have collected about you.  We do not sell the personal data of minors under 16 years of age without affirmative authorization.</li>
