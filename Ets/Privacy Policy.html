<p>In most cases, we do not knowingly collect Personal Information directly from children under the age of 16 on our Websites. Parents and schools may use our Websites to create accounts for children, such as registering them for tests. We encourage parents and teachers to spend time online with children and to monitor their online activities.

<p>ETS does provide parents and teachers with the ability to download certain apps that they and their children or students can use for educational purposes, such as to improve reading fluency. Some of these apps are intended for use by children under 13.</p>
<p>When children use these apps, ETS may collect the child's first name or nickname, age or grade in school, audio recordings of the child's voice when the child reads passages (or a transcript of the recording), the child's responses to questions that test skills such as reading comprehension, and other data relating to the child's use of the app, such as how long the child the spends using the app. Our apps do not collect any other Personal Information and they do not use cookies or other data collection technologies.</p>
<p>ETS anonymizes the information collected by its educational apps and uses the information for research purposes. ETS does not maintain identifiable data about children, and children cannot make their own data publicly available via the apps. ETS does not (and will not permit any third party to) associate identifying information with research data.</p>
<p>Parents and teachers can review and delete the child's information at any time in the app. Parents and teachers can restrict ETS's collection of additional information at any time by deleting the app. Parents or teachers who have any questions about how ETS handles children's data may contact ETS by sending us an email at <a href="mailto:etsinfo@ets.org">etsinfo@ets.org</a> or by calling us at <span class="text-bold">1-609-921-9000</span>.</p>

<h2 id="biometric">Biometric Identifiers</h2>
<p>Where permitted by law, ETS collects and uses biometric identifiers to identify and authenticate test takers and test center administrators. ETS collects digital photographs and digital voice recordings, and coverts these samples into mathematical representations called templates, which can be compared to the templates previously collected by ETS and to templates created from your government-issued identification documents. ETS uses these templates solely to support test security and integrity and for related purposes (such prosecution of fraud or intellectual property theft). Biometric templates are securely stored and only accessible to those individuals and entities who reasonably need access to the data in connection with investigations, compliance and security or who provide support for the biometric program. Biometric identifiers are retained for three years, unless a shorter period is required by law. To receive a copy of our Biometric Information Privacy Policy, please contact us via email to <a href="mailto:etsinfo@ets.org">etsinfo@ets.org</a> or write to us at the addresses in the Contact section below.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h2 id="research">Use of Information by ETS Research</h2>
<p>ETS uses anonymized and pseudonymized information for various research initiatives. For example, ETS may consider how certain types of test takers (such as nonnative English speakers) respond to specific test questions. Similarly, educational apps, such as Relay Reader<span class="tm">&trade;</span>, collect data to help ETS understand and improve reading skills. ETS's research initiatives reflect our commitment to fairness and equity in testing, helping to ensure that our tests are accessible and free from bias. They also seek to improve teaching, learning and assessment.</p>
<p>ETS may process Personal Information as needed to create de-identified datasets for research. ETS will not (and will not permit any third party to) associate identifying information with research data. Our research results do not contain any identifiable data, and research data are not used to target or profile individuals.</p>

<p><span class="text-bold">The Purposes and Legal Basis for Processing, Including Legitimate Interests</span> <br /> The Privacy Notice explains the reasons why we process your Personal Information. We only process Personal Information when we have a legal basis for the processing, such as:</p>

<li>To fulfill a contract with you, such as to provide you with an ETS test or a test offered by another company through ETS.</li>
<li>For closely related purposes, such as payment processing and financial account management, contract management, website administration, business continuity and disaster recovery, security and fraud prevention, corporate governance, reporting and legal compliance.</li>
<li>With your consent (or provided you have not objected, as may be applicable), such to provide you with marketing communications or to send your scores to your designated recipients.</li>

<li>Understand and improve our business, improve test integrity and for research purposes</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="text-bold">Automated Decision Making and Profiling</span> <br /> ETS may use automated processes in connection with scoring tests and for similar purposes as needed to provide the test services that you have requested. All such decisions are subject to human review. We will not make automated decisions about you that may significantly affect you, unless (1) the decision is necessary as part of a contract that we have with you, (2) we have your explicit consent, or (3) we are required by law to use the technology. You can learn more about test scoring by reading the information posted on our Website about each of our tests.</p>
<p>In some cases, we use certain elements of personal data for ETS Research. For example, we may consider how certain types of test takers (such as nonnative English speakers) respond to specific test questions. Our research initiatives reflect our commitment to fairness and equity in testing, helping to ensure that our tests are accessible and free from bias. They also seek to improve teaching, learning and assessment. Our research results do not contain any identifiable data, and are not used to target or profile individuals. Learn more about <a href="/research">ETS Research</a>.</p>
<p><span class="text-bold">When You Are Required to Provide Personal Information to ETS</span> <br /> In most cases, you are not required by law to provide any Personal Information to ETS. You are required to provide certain Personal Information to enable us to enter into a contract with you so that you can use our products and services.
