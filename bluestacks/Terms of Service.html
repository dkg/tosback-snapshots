<h2 id="change"><b>Will these Terms ever change?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services.  We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the website (https://www.bluestacks.com/terms.html), by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services.  However, if you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and BlueStacks.</span></p>
<h2 id="about"><b>What about my privacy?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlueStacks takes the privacy of its users very seriously.  For the current BlueStacks Privacy Policy, please click </span><a href="/terms-and-privacy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13.  We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us.  If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at eula at bluestacks dot com.</span></p>
<h2 id="what"><b>What are the basics of using BlueStacks?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be required to download and install certain software to your mobile device or computer, and sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“BlueStacks User ID”).  You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your BlueStacks User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you.  If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password.  You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.</span><b></b></p>

Third Party Services may be subject to limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in the use of such Third Party Services. Your right to use Third Party Services is governed by the terms of the license agreements for Third Party Services specified by such third party and not under this Terms of Use.

<h2 id="will"><b>Will BlueStacks ever change the Services?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice. </span></p>
<h2 id="does"><b>Does BlueStacks cost anything?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our Services are currently free. We reserve the right to require payment of fees for certain or all Services. To the extent that certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the “Paid Services”), the following terms apply: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Billing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your BlueStacks account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.<br />
If the Payment Processor identifies or we otherwise believe that your transaction may pose an unacceptable level of risk, that you have breached these Terms, or that your account has been compromised, we may take various actions to avoid liability and reduce potential fraud and disputes. The actions we may take (and we expressly reserve the right to take) include, but are not limited to, suspending or limiting your ability to purchase any Paid Services, refusing or rejecting your transaction, or blocking you from accessing or using some or part of the Services (especially for users with a record of fraudulent transactions, requesting refunds on multiple occasions without valid reasons, having caused chargebacks, or otherwise posing high risks). If possible, we will provide you with advance notice of our actions and resolution steps. However, advance notice will not be provided if there is an immediate need to take actions such as a security threat, potential fraud, or illegal activity.<br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Payment Method</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Current Information Required</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your billing account.  You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date) through your BlueStacks account, and you must promptly notify us or our payment processor if your payment method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password.  Changes to such information can be made through your BlueStacks account. If you fail to provide any of the foregoing information, you agree that we may continue charging you for any use of Paid Services under your billing account unless you have terminated your Paid Services by means of sending us an email to premium dot support at bluestacks dot com.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Change in Amount Authorized</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Reaffirmation of Authorization</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Subscription Services. </b></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Good standing:</strong> BlueStacks reserves the right to offer the premium subscription version of the Services (“Subscription Services”) to you only if you are a customer in good standing. BlueStacks reserves the right to refuse Subscription Services for any other reason including but not limited to a) your creditworthiness, b) you have purchased Subscription Services and cancelled them frequently in the past, or c) you have disputed payments for Subscription Services with your credit card company without pursuing the nominal cancellation process through premium dot support at bluestacks.com.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Fees and Payments.</strong> You agree to pay the subscription fees and any other charges (including any applicable taxes) incurred in connection with using software and Services at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. The subscription fees stated at the time of purchase will be charged to your credit card. As soon as BlueStacks has received full payment, your paid premium subscription will begin. BlueStacks will bill all charges automatically to your credit card. Subscription fees will be billed at the beginning of your subscription period or any renewal. Unless BlueStacks states in writing otherwise, all fees and charges are nonrefundable. BlueStacks may change the fees and charges then in effect, or add new fees or charges, by giving you notice in advance. If you want to use a different credit card or there is a change in credit card validity or expiration date, please respond to the subscription confirmation email to make changes. If you believe someone has accessed Services using Your user name and password without Your authorization, please contact premium dot support at bluestacks dot com. You are responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access Services through an Internet access provider or other third-party service.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Auto-Renewal.</strong> Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your BlueStacks account any subscription services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your subscription services at any time, go to your BlueStacks account.  If you terminate a subscription service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cancellation.</strong> For annual subscriptions, BlueStacks will contact you within a reasonable time before the expiry of your subscription term to give you the opportunity to cancel or opt out of the renewal of your subscription for a further year. If you fail to opt out, your subscription will automatically renew on the subscription expiry date, at the then current yearly subscription rate, and you will be charged accordingly, except as otherwise required by law. For all subscriptions, you must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of subscription fees for the renewal term to your credit card. BlueStacks may cancel your subscription at any time by notifying you. You may cancel your subscription by contacting our Customer Support at premium dot support at bluestacks dot com.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Refund.</strong> If you cancel a yearly subscription before 30 days after the subscription start date, you will generally be entitled a full refund for any reason. If you cancel a yearly subscription between 2 and 6 months after the subscription start date, you will generally be entitled to a pro rata refund for any unused months.  No refund will be paid (and no cancellation fee will apply) in relation to month-to-month subscriptions, trial subscriptions, or yearly subscriptions cancelled after 6 months of the subscription start date.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="gift-card"><b>What do I need to know about purchasing gift cards issued by third party merchants through BlueStacks?</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlueStacks may offer gift cards issued by third parties (“Merchants”) for purchase through the BlueStacks App Player (“Gift Cards”), to be used to redeem or in exchange for goods or services at such Merchants’ websites and/or places of business. <strong>Gift Cards are void where prohibited by law.</strong><br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Merchant, not BlueStacks, is the issuer of Gift Cards and the provider of such redeemable goods and services and is solely responsible for redeeming any Gift Card you purchase. Merchant is solely responsible for any and all damages, claims, losses, and costs suffered by you in connection with the redemption of any Gift Card, and for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed Gift Cards or portions thereof.</strong></li>
<li>The terms and conditions of redemption and any restrictions that apply to the use of each Gift Card (“Gift Card Terms”) may vary from Merchant to Merchant (which may include, without limitation, whether the Gift Card can be redeemed for alcoholic beverages, whether the Gift Card can be combined with other offers, whether a Gift Card can be redeemed incrementally or must be used all at once, whether the Gift Card has an expiration date, and whether the Gift Card is refundable). The Gift Card Terms will be noted on such Gift Cards or at the time of purchase. You can check some of the Gift Card Terms here <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/card-terms/">https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_us/about/card-terms/</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_at/about/card-terms/">https://play.google.com/intl/ALL_at/about/card-terms/</a> but please note that the Merchants may impose additional terms, conditions, and restrictions.</li>
<li>Your interactions with the Merchants, including the redemption and use of the Gift Cards and delivery of the goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with the Gift Card and such dealings, are solely between you and such Merchants. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any purchase of the Gift Cards issued by such Merchants. You agree that BlueStacks shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. To the extent permitted by the applicable laws, BlueStacks does not issue any refund for Gift Cards of Merchants purchased through BlueStacks. For the avoidance of doubt, this doesn’t affect your right to refund (if any) granted to you by the applicable Merchant pursuant to the Gift Card Terms.</li>
<li>Some Gift Cards may carry expiration dates. These expiration dates indicate the last date you can use the Gift Card at a Merchant; however, applicable law may provide that the Merchant must refund the cash value you paid for the Gift Card (i.e., not the face value of the Gift Card) for a period of time beyond the stated expiration date. In the event that you have not redeemed a Gift Card in full by the stated expiration date, please contact the applicable Merchant. The Merchant will refund any amounts due to you under applicable law. The issuance of Merchant credit for unredeemed Gift Cards is at the sole discretion of the Merchant, unless otherwise required by applicable law; Bluestacks cannot grant you Merchant credit without the approval of Merchant.</li>
<li>In some situations, according to applicable law, Merchant may be responsible for allowing you to redeem your Gift Card for cash, taking into consideration the amount remaining on the Gift Card and the amount you actually paid for the Gift Card (i.e., not the face value of the Gift Card). The Merchant will refund any amounts due to you under applicable law.</li>
<li>Some Gift Cards may have statutory limits on the amount of the Gift Card that can be redeemed for alcoholic beverages. Compliance with statutes or codes is the responsibility of the Merchant, not BlueStacks. Such limitations may or may not be noted at the time of purchase.</li>
<li>Bluestacks is not responsible for lost, stolen, or the unauthorized use of a Gift Card. Reproduction, sale, or trade of a Gift Card is prohibited unless done in compliance with applicable law. Any attempted redemption of a Gift Card not consistent with these terms and the applicable Gift Card Terms is void.</li>

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">c) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We use cookies to enhance your experience on our website. Cookies are pieces of information that are stored on the hard drive of your computer and are used for record-keeping purposes. Use of cookies facilitates web surfing by performing certain functions. You may refuse to accept cookies when you are alerted to their existence by us or by activating the setting on your browser, which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our website.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Services may use the following cookies:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cookie which recognizes a user’s browser type, browser language, the date and time of a user’s request and referral URL;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services.

<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">d) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third Party App Information</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When you download and install applications from a third party, or when you permit such third party applications to be updated, we may record information about the source, such as the name of the app store or app market, its IP address, the application version number, or any unique application identification number associated with them.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">e) Geo-location Information</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When you use a location-enabled app and if you have opted in for the app to access your location, we may collect, process and retain information about your actual location. We may use geo-location information to the greatest extent permitted by law. Some devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. The location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by us to provide and improve location based products and services. By using a location-enabled app, you consent to us processing information about your actual location.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave the websites of our Services.  Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.  Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time.</span></p>
<p><b>Will BlueStacks Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives</b><b>?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">provided certain Personal Information may be transferred in connection with business transfers, as described below. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</span></p>
<p><b>Information that’s no longer personally identifiable.  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide anonymized information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To gain a better understanding of how our users use our Services, BlueStacks may track user actions (such actions may include, without limitation, downloads completed successfully; installations completed successfully; Android apps installed successfully; Android apps started successfully; Android apps failed to start; and Android apps started but failed midstream) and record or report them over the Internet to a central analytics database.  We use Google Analytics to grow our business, to improve or develop our products, to monitor and analyze use of our Services, for our technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to verify that users have the authorization needed for us to process their requests. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, visit http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html. You can opt out of the Google Analytics by visiting </span><a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Advertisers:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are.  Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.</span></p>
<p><b>Affiliated Businesses:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</span></p>
<p><b>Agents:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use certain third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve our Services (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and payment processing) for purposes of and under obligations to adequately safeguard the information.  Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us or perform the tasks on our behalf. </span></p>
<p><b>User Profiles and Submissions:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services.    Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone.  Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.</span></p>
<p><b>Business Transfers:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. </span></p>
<p><b>Compliance with Laws; Protection of BlueStacks and Others:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to (a) comply with law or court order; (b) enforce or apply our </span><a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/terms.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terms of Use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other agreements; (c) or protect the rights, property, or safety of BlueStacks, our employees, our users, or others; or (d) prevent fraud or abuse of Bluestacks, our employees, our users, or others. </span></p>
<p><b>Is Personal Information about me secure</b><b>?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.  If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service.  You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.  If we receive instructions using your BlueStacks account information we will consider that you have authorized the instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records. But unfortunately, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee complete security.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. </span></p>
<p><b>What Personal Information can I access</b><b>?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please keep your information up to date and accurate. Through your account settings or by using features of our Services, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:</span></p>
<h4></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nickname</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">email address </span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change.  If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at privacy@bluestacks.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.  If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to: </span><a href="mailto:privacy@bluestacks.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy at bluestacks dot com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>What do I need to know about my data if I am located in the EU?</b></p>

We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.
