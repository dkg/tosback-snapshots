    <h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Overview</h3>
    <p><a href="#PayPal">PayPal</a> has developed this Privacy Statement to explain how we may collect, retain, process,        share and transfer your <a href="#Personal Data">Personal Data</a> when you visit our <a href="#Sites">Sites</a>        or use our <a href="#Services">Services</a>.

    <p>We have defined some terms that we use throughout the Privacy Statement.  You can find the meaning of a        capitalized term in the <a href="#13">Definitions</a> section.</p>
    <p>Please <a href="#12">contact us</a> if you have questions about our privacy practices that are not addressed in        this Privacy Statement.</p>
    <h3><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. What Personal Data Do We Collect?</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Registration and use information – </strong>When you register to use our Services by            establishing an Account, we will collect Personal Data as necessary to offer and fulfill the Services you            request.  Depending on the Services you choose, we may require you to provide us with your name, postal            address, telephone number, email address and identification information to establish an Account.  We            may require you to provide us with additional Personal Data as you use our Services.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction and experience information –</strong> When you use our Services or access our            Sites, for example, to make purchases from merchants, to receive money, to process payments, or to send            money to friends and family, we collect information about the transaction, as well as other information            associated with the transaction such as amount sent or requested, amount paid for products or services,            merchant information, including information about any funding instruments used to complete the transaction,            Device Information, Technical Usage Data, and Geolocation Information.</li>
        <li><strong>Participant information –</strong> When you use our Services or access our Sites, we collect Personal Data you provide us about the other participants associated with the transaction.<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li><strong>Send or request money:  </strong>When you send or request money through the Services,                    we collect Personal Data such as name, postal address, telephone number, and financial account                    information about the participant who is receiving money from you or sending money to you.  The                    extent of Personal Data required about a participant may vary depending on the Services you are                    using to send or request money.  </li>
                <li><strong>Pay or request someone else to pay a bill: </strong> If you use our Services to pay a                    bill for the benefit of someone else, or if you request a User to pay a bill for you, we collect                    Personal Data from you about the account holder such as name, postal address, telephone number,                    email address, and account number of the bill that you intend to pay or request to be paid.</li>
                <li><strong>Add value to your accounts: </strong> If you use our Services to add value to your                    Account or any other account you may have, or if you ask a User to add value to any of these                    accounts, we may collect Personal Data from you about the other party, or from the other party about                    you to facilitate the request.  For example, if you use our Services to reload a mobile phone,                    or to request value be added to your mobile account, we may collect Personal Data and other                    information including mobile account number from the other participant.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Information about your public profile and your friends and contacts – </strong>It may be easier for us to help you transact with your friends and contacts if you choose to connect your contact list information with your Account or if your Account profile is publicly available. If you establish an account connection between your device or a social media platform and your Account, we will use your contact list information (such as name, address, email address) to improve your experience when you use the Services. When your Account profile is public, other users can find your profile to send you money by searching for you by name, username, email, or mobile number on PayPal and confirm it’s you by viewing your photo. You can make your Account profile private anytime in your PayPal.me settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Information that you choose to provide us to obtain additional Services or specific online Services                – </strong>If you request or participate in an optional Site feature, or request enhanced Services            or other elective functionality, we may collect additional information from you.  We will provide you            with a separate notice at the time of collection, if the use of that information differs from the uses            disclosed in this Privacy Statement.  </li>
        <li><strong>Personal Data about you if you use unbranded Services – </strong>certain Services are available without being required to log in to or establish an Account. We will collect Personal Data when you are interacting with and making payments to merchants using our card payment services that do not carry the PayPal brand and when you checkout with PayPal without logging into an account. For our unbranded payment services, your interaction is with the merchant, on their platform. If you are an Account holder, or create an Account at a later date, we may collect information about unbranded transactions and associate them with your Account to improve your customer experience as an Account holder and for compliance and analytics purposes. If you are not an Account holder, we will collect and store all information you provide and use such information in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</li>
        <li><strong>Information about you from third-party sources – </strong>We obtain information from            third-party sources such as merchants, data providers, and credit bureaus, where permitted by law.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Other information we collect related to your use of our Sites or Services –</strong> We may            collect additional information from or about you when you communicate with us, contact our customer support            teams or respond to a survey.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. Why Do We Retain Personal Data?</h3>
    <p>We retain Personal Data to fulfill our legal or regulatory obligations and for our business purposes.  We        may retain Personal Data for longer periods than required by law if it is in our legitimate business interests        and not prohibited by law.  If your Account is closed, we may take steps to mask Personal Data and other        information, but we reserve our ability to retain and access the data for so long as required to comply with        applicable laws.  We will continue to use and disclose such Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy        Statement.</p>

    <p><strong>With your consent: </strong>We also will share your Personal Data and other information with your consent        or direction, including if you authorize an account connection with a third-party account or platform. </p>
    <p>In addition, PayPal may provide aggregated statistical data to third-parties, including other businesses and        members of the public, about how, when, and why Users visit our Sites and use our Services.  This data will        not personally identify you or provide information about your use of the Sites or Services.  We do not        share your Personal Data with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent.</p>
    <h3><a id="6" name="6"></a>6. How Do We Work with Other Services and Platforms?<strong>  </strong></h3>
    <p>A significant benefit and innovation of PayPal’s Services is that you can connect your Account with a        third-party account or platform.  For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, an “account        connection” with such a third-party is a connection you authorize or enable between your Account and a        non-PayPal account, payment instrument, or platform that you lawfully control or own.  When you authorize        such a connection, PayPal and the third-party will exchange your Personal Data and other information        directly.  Examples of account connections include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>linking your Account to a social media account or social messaging service;</li>
        <li>connecting your Account to a third-party data aggregation or financial services company, if you provide such            company with your Account log-in credentials; or</li>
        <li>using your Account to make payments to a merchant or allowing a merchant to charge your Account.</li>

    <p>If you choose to create an account connection, we may receive information from the third-party about you and your        use of the third-party’s service.  For example, if you connect your Account to a social media        account, we will receive Personal Data from the social media provider via the account connection.  If you        connect your Account to other financial accounts, directly or through a third-party service provider, we may        have access to your account balance and transactional information, such as purchases and funds transfers.         We will use all such information that we receive from a third-party via an account connection in a manner        consistent with this Privacy Statement. </p>
    <p>Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection will be used and disclosed in        accordance with the third-party’s privacy practices.  Before authorizing an account connection, you        should review the privacy notice of any third-party that will gain access to your Personal Data as part of the        account connection.  For example, Personal Data that PayPal shares with a third-party account or platform        such as a social media account may in turn be shared with certain other parties, including the general public,        depending on the account’s or platform’s privacy practices. </p>
