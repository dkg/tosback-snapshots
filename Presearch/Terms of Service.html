  <p>
  Presearch offers Members rewards for using the service, namely, Presearch Tokens ("PRE") in exchange for searching, engaging with sponsored content, and choosing specific paid search resources. As such, these incentive mechanisms are potentially subject to attempted fraud and abuse, and therefore, to protect the project and its Members, fraud, and abuse of any sort will absolutely not be tolerated. In the event that Presearch detects fraud or abuse on your part, we reserve the right to terminate your account and cancel any rewards provided. Additionally, we may take steps to further prevent you from using the service, and we also reserve the right to prosecute you for fraudulent activity. Abuse is defined as intentionally attempting to earn additional rewards that you would not earn under regular use. For example, running automated programs or bots designed to earn rewards, doing searches more frequently than you would under normal circumstances in an attempt to earn rewards beyond those which would typically be provided, or creating multiple accounts to bypass account limits and restrictions. There is an automated anti-abuse system in place that analyzes your search behaviour on an ongoing basis to determine whether you are abusing the reward system. You will be assigned a PRE Level between 0 and 10, which will affect the rewards that you are able to withdraw from the system.
  </p>
  <h3>Rewards and Withdrawals</h3>


  <p>
  Before a Presearch Member can use their Presearch Reward Tokens or withdraw them to the Presearch blockchain, Tokens must be verified and marked as Eligible for withdrawal.
  </p>
  <p>
  The percentage of your Reward Tokens that are eligible for withdrawal will correspond to your PRE Level and are called 'Eligible Tokens':
  </p>

  <table class="table table-condensed table-nonfluid">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>PRE Level</th>
        <th>Eligible Tokens</th>
      <tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Level 8-10:</td>

  <p>
  In order to initiate a withdrawal of PRE Tokens to a blockchain address, all Members must first have more than 1,000 Eligible Tokens and supply an ERC20-compatible wallet address.
  </p>
  <p>
  Withdrawals can currently only be done in batches of 1,000 tokens. This means that you will only be able to withdraw 1,000 tokens to start. This is done to protect the project from significant <a href="https://engine.presearch.org/search?q=ethereum+gas">Ethereum Gas</a> costs generated by processing many smaller transactions.   You will be able to withdraw up to 1,000 tokens every 90 days, unless otherwise approved.
  </p>
  <p>
  Once a withdrawal request is initiated, it will need to be approved by a Presearch administrator. If a request has been issued or otherwise allowed due to a system error or malicious activity, Presearch reserves the right to block a request at the approval stage. Presearch endeavours to approve all legitimate requests within 3 business days. If your request is initially denied for any reason, you will be notified by a message on the site and will be directed to contact <a href="mailto:support@presearch.io">support@presearch.io</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  You may be limited to a certain number of withdrawals in a certain period of time, or a certain number of tokens at a single time or in a period of time. This number may change based on your PRE Level or on the needs of the project.
  </p>
  <p>
  If your account is left dormant for more than one year, meaning that you do not login or record a search for 365 days, Presearch reserves the right to rescind any reward tokens in your account. That does not necessarily mean it will be done, but that the right is there. This does not apply to tokens that have been purchased.
  </p>
