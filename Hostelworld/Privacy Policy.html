                            <li><strong>Email Marketing</strong> - When we collect your email address, we will record your preferences regarding receipt of marketing and promotional emails from us in relation to our own products and services and those of third parties.</li>

                        <p><strong>Personal information that we collect automatically:</strong> <br>When you use the Hostelworld Platform, our various technologies to automatically capture details about the device you are using and how you interact with us. This information includes:</p>

                        <p><strong>Personal information we receive from other sources:</strong> <br>Although we mainly collect information directly from you, there are circumstances where we collect information from third party sources. These circumstances include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Affiliates</strong> - We operate an affiliate programme under which third parties advertise our website on our behalf. If you click on one of those advertisements you are directed to our website using a technology that allows us to understand which affiliate referred you. We then track if you make a booking, and if you do, we attribute that booking to the affiliate for the purposes of paying them a commission. However, we don't provide the affiliate with any personal information about you.</li>

<li><strong>Group Companies</strong> - We may receive personal data about you from one of our group companies such as Hostelworld Services Limited in the UK, who handle all our marketing and promotions and Counter App Limited, our property management and payment solutions platform.</li>
<li><strong>Strategic Partners</strong> - We may receive your personal data from partner companies we work closely with and companies we invest in, such as Goki Pty Ltd. in Australia with whom we partner to enable Goki guests to access to HW inventory of hostel accommodation, allowing them to make their next booking after check-out and move seamlessly between the two platforms, whether this is to engage directly with other guests, the hostel or to book ancillary activities.</li>

                            <li><strong>Properties</strong> - If there are any issues with your stay at a property, the property might contact us with information about the issue.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tours</strong> - If there are any issues with your experience on a tour, the tour operator or tour aggregator platform might contact us with information about the issue.</li>

                <div class="item"><h2>Why do you use my personal data?</h2>

<p>As you probably expect, the main reason we use your personal data is in order to process your accommodation and tour/experience bookings and to deal with any queries or issues that arise in relation to those bookings. We also use your personal data for a number of other reasons, such as tailoring adverts and our marketing emails so they are relevant to you, monitoring your use of the HW Platform to help us make improvements, and to provide the additional services that we make available on our website and apps. For more details about why we use your personal data, <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com/cookiespolicy.php" class="clickme">click here</a>.</p>

<div class="item-level2">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Bookings</strong> - We use your personal data in order to process bookings with properties and tour/experience providers and aggregators, and to let you manage your bookings through the HW Platform. Where we process personal data for this purpose, we will do so either on the basis that we have a contractual obligation to you or a third party to do so, or on the basis of our legitimate interests in providing the booking service.</li>
                            <li><strong>Queries and Complaints</strong> - When you send us a query in relation to a booking, or if you have a complaint in relation to a property or tour/experience, we will process your personal data in order to answer your query or in order to help resolve your complaint. Where we process personal data in the context of a query or complaint, we will do so on the basis of our legitimate interest in resolving customer queries and complaints. If you volunteer data in relation to your health, we will process that personal data on the basis that you consent to us using it in order to resolve your query or complaint only.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reviews</strong> - When you provide a review for a property or tour/experience, we will publish this on the property's page or the tour/experience’s page on our website, and on our some of our partners' sites. We will display the text of your review, alongside details of your gender, age range, home country and number of previous reviews. If you have not opted to be anonymous, we will also display your username alongside your review. Our processing of your personal data in order to make reviews available is on the basis of our legitimate interest in making the review system available to our users.</li>
                            <li><strong>Providing and Improving our Services</strong> - Where we collect data in relation to your use of our services, such as your device details and how you interact with our services, we use this data in order to deliver our services and personalise your experience (e.g. if you turn on location services on your mobile device, we will use this as part of the search function). We also use the data to test new features that we are thinking about introducing, to analyse how our website is used, and to evaluate and improve our services. If we find a problem on our websites or apps, we will use your data in order to fix any bugs that we find. We may also process your personal data as part of our development work, where we take a copy of our database and test our code on that before rolling it out to the live version of the database. Where possible, we use this data on an anonymous basis, but sometimes this might not be possible. All of this processing of your personal data is on the basis of our legitimate interests in operating, improving and securing our services. Please also see our separate notice in relation to the testing that we undertake.</li>
                            <li><strong>Analysis/Reporting</strong> - We use data in relation to bookings in order to create internal reports using Google Analytics regarding how our business is operating, such as determining how what we  spend on advertising affects the number of bookings that are made. We also use this data for other commercial analysis purposes, and to try to predict future trends that may affect our business. This processing is undertaken on an aggregated basis, so you are not identifiable from the reports or analysis that is produced.</li>
                            <li><strong>Advertising</strong> - We always want to ensure that when you see a Hostelworld advert, it will be relevant to you and your interests, whether the advert appears on a website we operate, in our marketing emails or on a third-party site. We may also use the same information to show you adverts for carefully selected third-party products and services. We do this in a number of ways, either ourselves or through the use of third-party advertisers:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Making Adverts Relevant To You</strong> - When you are using our websites and apps, we use the searches you have made and the properties and tours/experiences that you have looked at in order to tailor our adverts to your interests. For example, if you have been searching for hostels in Paris or tours in Bangkok, we might use this information to display adverts to you on our websites and on third party websites for hostels in Paris or tours in Bangkok that you might be interested in. We may also use this information in order to tailor the adverts that appear in our email newsletter. We may also use data about your past transactions on the website to tailor our advertising. For example, if we notice you haven't made any bookings for a while, we might send you a credit to your account as an incentive to make a new booking. We process your personal data in connection with tailoring our adverts on the basis of our legitimate interests in ensuring that our advertising is effective.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Segmentation</strong> - When we develop some of our advertising campaigns, we have certain groups of people in mind who we want to see the advert. This might be people in a particular age range, people who have made a booking recently, or people from a particular geographic location or who speak a particular language. We use the data that we hold in order to create groups of people that we then display an advert to or ask our third-party advertising partners to display an advert to. We process your personal data in connection with creating these groups of people on the basis of our legitimate interests in ensuring that our advertising, or the advertising of third parties, is effective.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Audience Matching</strong> - Some of our advertising partners, like Facebook and Twitter, provide a feature that helps us to identify if we have customers or users in common. Rather than sharing personal data with our advertising partners in order to find out if we have customers or users in common, we actually share what is known as a "hash" of the data that we hold (such as an email address). A hash is created by a computer programme that converts data into a string of numbers and letters, but only operates in one direction. This means that you can't use a hash to find out the underlying information, but if you run the hash on the same data you always get the same results. Our advertising partners compare their hashes with the hashes we send them, and if there is a match you are added to our custom audience. The hashes are then deleted by the advertising partner. We use audience matching to enable us to show you more relevant adverts, or to ensure that we don't show you an advert that isn't relevant to you. We process your personal data in connection with audience matching on the basis of our legitimate interests in ensuring that our advertising, or the advertising of third parties, is effective.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Emails and App Notifications</strong> - Where we have collected your email address in the context of providing you with a service and you have not opted out of receiving email marketing, we may send you emails that we think will be useful to you. This may include our regular e-newsletter, special offers, travel tips, customer surveys and information about products and services offered by us. If you have given your consent, we will send you offers from selected third parties. These emails may include advertising that has been tailored using other information that we hold about you, as set out above in the 'Advertising' section. Where your settings on your device permit us to send app notifications, we may also send you app notifications containing similar information. You may opt out of receiving email messages at any time by clicking on the link provided in the email messages, and app notifications can be disabled by changing the notification settings in your app. Although when we send you an email or app notification this may in certain circumstances be on the basis of your consent, for all other purposes our processing of your personal data in connection with those emails or app notifications is on the basis of our legitimate interests in ensuring that our advertising is effective.</li>
                            <li><strong>Affiliate Programme</strong> - We operate an affiliate programme under which third parties advertise our website on our behalf. If you click on one of those advertisements you are directed to our website using a technology that allows us to understand which affiliate referred you. We then track if you make a booking, and if you do, we attribute that booking to the affiliate for the purposes of paying them a commission. However, we don't provide the affiliate with any personal information in relation to you. We process your personal data in connection with our affiliate programme on the basis of our legitimate interest in operating an effective commission based affiliate advertising programme.</li>
                            <li><strong>Competitions</strong> - We often run competitions on our website and on our social media channels. When we operate a competition, we may take the opportunity to also ask you some market research questions, so that we can better understand our business and your needs. We will therefore process your personal data in order to operate the competition, and for market research purposes. We process your personal data in connection with operating competitions on the basis of our legitimate interest in operating the competition and conducting market research. Please note that competitions may be subject to their own data protection notices and separate terms and conditions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Surveys</strong> - We sometimes undertake market research surveys to better understand our customers and prospective customers. These can be general surveys to understand the market, or they might be more specific to you. For example, we may want to understand if you are generally positive about Hostelworld or if you have concerns. We may then send you tailored communications on the basis of the survey responses. Where this is the case. we will let you know at the time that you complete the survey. We process your personal data in connection with our surveys on the basis of our legitimate interest in conducting market research and promoting our brands. Please note that surveys may be subject to their own data protection notices and separate terms and conditions.</li>


<li><strong>Webinars</strong> - We regularly run webinars on our website on topics we understand to be important to You and to promote new features and technologies we are developing and rolling out. We will therefore process your personal data in order to run the webinar and for follow-up market research purposes – We may contact You after the webinar to get Your feedback on the content, guest speakers and overall experience. We may also ask you if you consent to being contacted by guest speakers to discuss the topic of the webinar. We process your personal data in connection with running webinars on the basis of our legitimate interest in running webinars and conducting follow-up market research. Please note that webinars may be subject to the data protection notices and separate terms and conditions of the webinar software platform.</li>

<li><strong>Monitoring/Analytics </strong> - We use a variety of tools to give us insights into how our sites and apps are used to enable us to better tailor the customer experience, respond to market trends and resolve technical impediments those using the sites and apps may encounter.
<ul>

<li>We use Hotjar, which facilitates the visual representation of clicks, taps and scrolling behaviour to better understand how users interact with our sites to better inform our UI/UX decision making abilities. The privacy details on Hotjar can be found <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>

<li>We use Snowflake, a cloud-native data warehouse that supports our data analysis. The privacy details of Snowflake can be found <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>

<li>We use Tableau which has analytical tools to aid in visualising and understanding our raw data. The privacy details of Tableau can be found <a href="https://www.tableau.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</li>

<li>We also use a number of tools, including Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics, to better understand how our sites and apps are being used and enable us to build the right solution for you. This means we can find out what works and what doesn't, optimise and improve our websites or apps, understand the effectiveness of advertisements and communications, and ensure we continue to be interesting and relevant. The data we gather can include which web pages you have viewed, which referring/exit pages you have entered and left from, which platform type you have used, which emails you have opened and acted upon, and date and time stamp information.  It also means we can use details about how you’ve interacted with the site, such as the number of clicks you make on a given page, your mouse movements and scrolling activity, the search words you use and the text you enter into various fields. We send Adobe Analytics and Google Analytics website interaction data.

                <div class="item"><h2>Information you are required to provide</h2>

<p>You are not obliged to provide us with any of your personal data. However, if you want to make a booking, you will need to provide us with the information that is indicated as required on our checkout page. If you don't provide us with this information, we won't be able to process your booking. Similarly, you may be required to provide certain information if you want to enter into a competition, participate in a survey, book a tour/experience with a travel service provider or if you contact our Customer Services team with a query or complaint. We will inform you where such information is required.</p></div>
                <div class="item"><h2>Who do we share your personal data with?</h2>

<p>In order to process your booking, we have to send your details to the property or tour/experience provider/aggregator that you have booked. This includes making your credit or debit card details (not including the CVV code, which we do not store) available to the property or tour/experience provider/aggregator in order for them to take payments where this is required (e.g. the charges that are applicable if you fail to show up at a property or tour/experience and have not cancelled your booking in accordance with the travel service provider’s cancellation policy). If you purchase an ancillary service, we may need to share personal data with the third-party service provider so that they can provide you with that service.</p>

<p>As part of our online advertising programmes, we may share your personal data with third parties, who will combine it with data that they hold about you in order to tailor adverts that appear on third-party websites (which may be our own adverts, or adverts we serve on behalf of third parties). Where this data is shared, you are not directly identifiable from the information itself, as we use technologies that use non-personally identifiable codes and tags.</p>

<p>We also use a number of service providers to assist us in providing our services, some of whom will have access to your data (e.g. we use various software service providers who host our data as part of their services). Where we engage a third party to process your data on our behalf, we take reasonable steps to sure that they respect your privacy rights and that they process data in accordance with applicable data protection law.</p>

<p>Although we hope it never happens, on very rare occasions our customers can get into difficulties whilst travelling. Where we think that there is a risk to your health or wellbeing, we may share your personal data with third parties in order to get you help (e.g. we might be asked to assist with locating a missing person). We may also receive requests from law enforcement agencies for personal data that we hold. In such circumstances we will only share your personal data with such law enforcement agencies in compliance with applicable data protection law.</p>

<li><strong>Service Providers</strong> - As you can imagine, operating the world's largest online hostel booking platform requires a lot of work behind the scenes. We use a large number of specialist service providers to assist us in operating our business and to provide us with specialist services.

The categories of service providers that we currently engage include the following:
<ul>

<li><strong>Auditors</strong> - We have an internal and external audit function that is provided by third parties.

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Third-Party Advertisers</strong> - When we purchase advertising on third-party websites, we may share information with them about your use of our services, which they then combine with the information that they hold about you in order to implement the particular advertising campaign. The data that is shared with third-party advertisers relates to how you use our websites and apps, such as the pages you have visited, the searches you have made, and whether you have made a booking. We use specialist service providers to help us purchase advertising, and to transfer the information about your use of our services to third party advertisers that is required for those third party advertisers to be able to show you the correct advert.</li>
<li><strong>Ancillary Services</strong> - We sometimes work with partners to make services available to you that we think will be useful, such as travel insurance. If you avail of one of these services, we may need to provide your details to that third party in order to allow them to provide the service. We may also share non-personally identifiable information with the third party to enable them to track that we referred you to them.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction Data</strong> - If you are an active user of the HW Platform (i.e. you have made a booking in the last 18 months) we want to ensure that you have access to data in relation to your previous bookings, and that we have access to this data for our own business purposes. We therefore won't delete your transaction data whilst you remain an active customer, unless you ask us to do so. If you cease to be an active customer, we will retain your personal data for a period of 4 years, in case you return to our website and want to continue using your account, and also so that we can continue to use transaction data to improve our services and undertake business analysis. After this 4 year period, we anonymise the data, so that it is no longer possible for us to link it to you. However, our anonymisation process does let us re-identify you if you return to our site and use the same email address to make a booking. Please also note that if you are subscribed to our marketing database, we will retain certain details even after the 4 year period expires, as set out below.</li>
<li><strong>Email Marketing</strong> - We will keep a copy of personal data that is required in order to send you marketing messages for as long as you are subscribed to receive those marketing messages. We will also retain certain information in relation to your transactions in order to allow us to customise our marketing messages. If you are subscribed to receive marketing messages and your transaction data is anonymised in our main database, we will continue to retain certain details in relation to your transactions, such as where you have booked properties before, what types of property you have booked, whether you have used our apps or our websites, your average length of stay, and what countries you have made bookings for and in.</li>
</ul>
<p>For personal data that is not transaction data or related to email marketing, we will apply the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managing legal claims</strong> – When we assess how long we keep personal data, we take into account whether that data may be required in order to defend any legal claims which may be made. If such data is required, we may keep it until the statute of limitations runs out in relation to the type of claim that can be made (which varies from 2 to 12 years).</li>
<li><strong>Business requirements</strong> – As we only collect personal data for defined purposes, we assess how long we need to keep personal data for in order to meet our reasonable business purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever you use our online services, including our applications, cookies and other tracking technologies can be used in various ways, such as making the HW Platform work, to analyse traffic, or for advertisement purposes. These technologies are either used by us directly, or by our business partners, including third party service providers and advertisers we work with. We use cookies and similar technologies to improve your experience, to enhance site security and to show you relevant advertising – all to make your access to our services to be as easy, efficient and useful as possible. If you want to learn more about our cookies, please read our <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/cookiespolicy.php">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

<p>To learn more generally about cookies and how to manage or delete them, simply visit <a href="http://allaboutcookies.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">allaboutcookies.org</a> and the help section of your browser. In the settings for browsers such as Edge, Safari, Firefox or Chrome, you can set which cookies to accept and which to reject. Where you find these settings depends on which browser you use. Use the "Help" function in your browser to locate the settings you need.</p>

<p>If you choose not to accept certain technical and/or functional cookies, you may not be able to use some functions on of the HW Platform. We currently do not support “Do Not Track” browser settings. In case a common standard has been developed which defines what exactly is meant by “Do Not Track” browser signals, we will review this Cookie Statement again.</p>

<p>Advertising. When it comes to online advertising and marketing companies, we strive to work with companies that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and/or the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). Members of NAI and IAB adhere to industry standards and codes of conduct. NAI and IAB members allow you to opt out of behavioural advertising. Visit <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org</a> to identify the NAI members that may have placed an advertising cookie file on your computer.</p>

<p>To opt out of an NAI member's behavioural advertising program, simply check the box that corresponds to the company from which you wish to opt out. You may also want to visit <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.com</a> or

Your mobile device may allow you to limit the sharing of information for retargeting purposes through its settings. Please be aware that opting out of an online advertising network does not mean that you will no longer receive or be subject to online advertising or marketing analysis. It means that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and browsing patterns.</p>
