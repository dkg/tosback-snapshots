<p>Last updated: 14 August 2020</p>

<p>Welcome to Hostelworld.com, the global leader in hostel-focused online booking platforms! Headquartered in Dublin, with offices around the world in London, Shanghai, Sydney and Porto, Hostelworld has over 12 million reviews across 17,400 hostel properties in more than 178 countries.</p>

<p>These terms and conditions ("Terms") govern all bookings made through Our booking services, whether through Our websites, mobile websites, mobile applications or Our booking engine, which is integrated into third party websites (collectively the "Hostelworld Sites") for accommodation, tour, ticket, attraction or other travel experiences made available by third-party suppliers. However, We are not a travel or tour agency, and We do not provide such accommodation, travel or tour experiences ourselves. When you make a booking on the Hostelworld Sites, you will be purchasing accommodation, tours, tickets or other services directly from the third-party supplier.</p>

<p>All references to "We", "Us" or "Our" in these terms refer to Hostelworld.com Limited ("Hostelworld"), the operator of the Hostelworld Sites. When We refer to "you" or “your”, We mean any person that accesses or uses the Hostelworld Sites. Your use of the Hostelworld Sites and any bookings you make via the Hostelworld Sites are subject to these Terms and Our <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/securityprivacy.php">Data Protection Notice</a>, but please note that where you access Our booking engine on a third-party website, these Terms and Our <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/securityprivacy.php">Data Protection Notice</a> only apply to your use of the booking engine, and do not apply to any other use of that third-party website.</p>

<p>Please read these Terms carefully, as they contain important information concerning your legal rights and limitations on these rights, as well as information about applicable law and jurisdiction for any disputes. By accessing or using the Hostelworld Sites and/or Hostelworld’s services, you represent that you have read and understood these Terms and agree to use the Hostelworld Sites in accordance with and subject to these Terms and Our <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/securityprivacy.php">Data Protection Notice</a> without modification. If you do not accept these Terms and Our <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/securityprivacy.php">Data Protection Notice</a>, please do not use the Hostelworld Sites and do not make a booking via the Hostelworld Sites. In all booking arrangements, the person making the booking shall be deemed to have accepted these Terms on behalf of all the persons named in the booking.</p>

                            <h3>About Us</h3>

                            <h3>2. Bookings</h3>
<p>2.1 We facilitate the booking and processing of travel services as agents solely for and on behalf of third-party travel services providers. Our role is simply to facilitate you finding and choosing travel services. We do not act as an agent on your behalf in respect of any travel service booking with any travel services provider. We do not provide, own or run any travel services ourselves and in particular, We do not provide, own or run any accommodation. Although We provide the Hostelworld Sites with information about travel services and facilitate bookings, such actions do not in any way constitute Hostelworld's sponsorship or approval of such third party suppliers, or any affiliation between Hostelworld and any third party supplier. Although Hostelworld users may rate and write reviews of particular travel services based on their own experiences, Hostelworld does not endorse or recommend any travel services. You agree that Hostelworld is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information it obtains from third party suppliers and/or that is displayed on the Hostelworld Sites.</p>

<p>2.3 When you make a booking using the Hostelworld Sites, you agree to enter into a contract for travel services and your contract for travel services (including accommodation) is with the travel services provider, not Hostelworld, as We are only acting as agent for the travel services provider. For the avoidance of doubt, We do not act as your agent and have no authority to negotiate or conclude any agreement with a travel services provider on your behalf. You enter into the relevant agreement(s) with the travel services provider and any other agreements relating to the travel services or ancillary services, on your own behalf. It is the travel services provider's responsibility to provide you with the travel services. We are not responsible for the fulfilment of any booking made through the Hostelworld Sites or for the quality of any accommodation or any other travel services that are booked.</p>

<p>2.4 Please note that all bookings are strictly subject to the Hostelworld booking terms and conditions that will be displayed to you prior to you confirming your booking.</p>
                            <h3>3. Making, Amending and Cancelling a Booking</h3>
<p>3.1 On making an accommodation booking, you will be required to pay:</p>
<p>(a) where you select a Non-Refundable Booking rate or Flexible Non-Refundable Booking rate, the total price of your accommodation which We collect (in full or in part) for and on behalf of the travel services provider. This amount will always be non-refundable unless the travel services provider agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy; or</p>
<p>(b) a deposit (being a part payment towards the total value of your booking) which We collect for and on behalf of the travel services provider.  This amount will always be non-refundable unless the travel services provider agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy unless:</p>
<p>(i) the Standard Flexible Booking option is available and you choose to select it, in which case the deposit will be added back to your Hostelworld account in the form of a voucher if you cancel your booking in certain circumstances (see below for more details); or</p>
<p>(ii) the Free Cancellation Booking option is available and you choose to select it, in which case the deposit will be refunded back to your chosen method of payment within a commercially reasonable period of time from the date of cancellation if you cancel your booking within the specified time period on the Hostelworld Sites at the time of booking.</p>

<p>3.2 Where you select a Non-Refundable Booking rate or Flexible Non-Refundable Booking rate, the total cost of your booking will be charged any time after your booking has been confirmed. Upon confirming your booking, a deposit of the total amount will be charged onto your card straight away. The outstanding balance due for your booking will be charged on your card by the travel service provider any time from the moment of booking. If for some reason the travel service provider is unable to charge your card for the outstanding balance due for your booking, they may reach out to you directly and give you, at their discretion, a period of time during which you can provide an alternative payment method to charge the balance. If you do not provide an alternative payment method to the travel service provider within the time period given to you, the travel service provider reserves the right to cancel your booking and the deposit amount will be non-refundable.</p>

<p>3.3 Where you make an accommodation booking on a Flexible Non-Refundable Booking rate, you will be able to make one (1) change to your booking directly with the property before your original arrival date. Such changes may be to (i) change your booking dates; (ii) change the number of nights; (iii) change the number of guests; or (iv) change your room type. Any proposed change to be made to your booking will be strictly subject to the property’s availability. Where the booking price for the proposed new dates is higher than the original dates, the property will arrange directly with you to pay the difference. If the booking price for the new date is less than the original date, no refund shall be given. Once your amended booking is confirmed, the property will send you a confirmation email setting out the above information.</p>

<p>3.4 On making a booking for a tour or experience, you will always be required to pay the total price of your tour or experience at the time of booking which We collect (in full or in part) for and on behalf of the travel services provider. Certain tours and experiences can only be booked on the non-refundable payment of the total price of your tour or experience at the time of booking (“Non-Refundable Tour”). Non-Refundable Tours will always be non-refundable unless the travel services provider agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy. It will be made clear in the terms and conditions applicable to Non-Refundable Tours that they are Non-Refundable Tours. Any cancellation of tours or experiences that are not Non-Refundable Tours will be refundable only if cancelled within the cancellation period stated in the terms and conditions applicable to such tour or experience.</p>

<p>3.5 You may also be required to pay a flat booking fee for use of the Hostelworld Sites when a booking is made with a travel services provider. Where We charge a booking fee, it is non-refundable in all circumstances. We do not act as your agent and the booking fee is payable for use of the Hostelworld Sites and is separate from any deposit payable to the travel services provider.</p>

<p>3.6 Unless either the Hostelworld booking terms and conditions displayed to you before you confirm your booking or the travel service provider’s terms and conditions state otherwise, you will be responsible for paying of the balance of the cost of the booking made by you to the travel services provider on arrival, together with any other payments for any additional goods or services subsequently agreed with the travel services provider. You will also be responsible for the payment of the travel services provider's service charges and taxes, pursuant to the terms and conditions of trade applied by such travel services provider, where applicable.</p>

<p>3.7 You must use a credit card or debit card to guarantee a booking. By making a booking with your credit card or debit card, you agree to accept the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of the travel services provider as set out in its terms and conditions. In the event that you cancel your booking: 
(a) outside the permitted timeframe specified in the travel service provider’s terms and conditions; or 
(b) in the case of Free Cancellation Bookings, the timeframe specified on the Hostelworld Site at the time of booking; or 
(c) you fail to arrive by your agreed accommodation check-in time (“no-show”),
you authorise the travel services provider to charge to your credit card or debit card, without further reference to you, an amount not exceeding the charge for one night's stay (in the case of accommodation) or such other amount as may be set out in the travel service provider's terms and conditions. Please note that there will be no additional charges for cancellations or no-shows in respect of Non-Refundable Bookings, but you will not be refunded the cost of any part of your booking in such circumstances.
</p>

<p>3.8 Your no-show may result in the cancellation of your entire booking. Any amendments to your booking must be notified to and agreed with the travel services provider directly (but no refund of all or any part of the deposit will be made). Please note it is not possible to amend Non-Refundable Bookings and you will not be refunded the cost of your Non-Refundable Booking if you cancel your booking or do not use the related accommodation booked. In making a booking, it shall be your sole responsibility to disclose to the travel services provider any requirements or special facilities that you or a member of your party may need as a result of any medical conditions.</p>

<p>3.9 When a booking is confirmed, We will issue the booking confirmation on behalf of the travel services provider for each booking, but We will not provide information about any charges for additional services. We will endeavour to ensure that the booking confirmation includes details of all taxes charged by the travel services provider, in relation to which please see clause 12.9 below. Where you make permissible changes to a Flexible Non-Refundable Booking, the travel services provider will issue the revised booking confirmation directly to you. We strongly recommend you check and confirm with the travel services provider the precise terms and conditions upon which the travel services provider makes the reserved service available to you upon receipt of the booking confirmation. The reference numbers included on the booking confirmation should be quoted in all enquiries, cancellation or modification of the booking.</p>

<p>3.10 You do not have an automatic right to cancel any booking you make unless such rights are provided to you by the travel services provider under their specific terms and conditions as disclosed on the booking confirmation and detailed property description page at the time of booking. Deadlines for cancellation under a travel service provider’s cancellation policy are normally at least 24 hours before your agreed check-in date, unless otherwise stated by the travel service provider. Please cancel by accessing the cancellation function available on the Hostelworld Sites. For details regarding the cancellation of Free Cancellation Bookings, please see below.</p>

<p>3.11 If you choose the Standard Flexible Booking option when making your booking (where it is available), you will be charged a small fee and, in return, if you later decide to cancel your booking, your deposit will be added back as a voucher to your Hostelworld account in Euro (provided you have given the period of notice required by the travel services provider, for which please see its terms) and you will be able to re-use that voucher amount for future bookings on the Hostelworld Sites for a period of 6 months from the cancellation date. Where you originally paid your deposit in a currency other than Euro, We will convert the booking deposit amount into Euro using Hostelworld’s standard exchange rates for the purpose of adding the voucher to your Hostelworld account. Your booking fee is always non-refundable.</p>

<p>3.12 If you make a Non-Refundable Booking or Flexible Non-Refundable Booking and you cancel your booking then, regardless of how much notice you give, deposits and booking fees will be non-refundable. Non-Flexible Booking and Flexible Non-Refundable Booking customers should note that, even though your deposit and booking fee will be non-refundable in any event, you must give the amount of notice stipulated by the travel services provider in its cancellation policy, in order to avoid being charged an additional payment for a "no show" (see clause 3.7 above).</p>

<p>3.13 Where you select Standard Flexible Booking (where it is available) for your booking, the following provisions will apply:
(a) Your deposit will only be added back as a voucher where (i) you have given the amount of notice for your cancellation that is required by the travel services provider in its terms and conditions and, in any event, you have given no less than 24 hours' notice prior to the scheduled check-in date; (ii) you have processed your cancellation online through the cancellation function available on the Hostelworld Sites; and (iii) you have cancelled your full booking (partial cancellations, such as cancellations of 1 night of a 2-night stay, are not protected by cancellation protection).
(b) Your  voucher will be applied to the account which is linked in Our records to the email address that was used to process the initial booking. Vouchers cannot be applied to an account that does not relate to the booking email address.
(c) Vouchers must be used within 6 months of the cancellation date, after which it is forfeited. Credit will not be applied to your account in respect of cancellations made by telephone or email.
(d) In order to use your voucher, simply go to www.hostelworld.com and make a booking using the same email address. Your voucher will be automatically applied to your booking once you confirm the reservation.
(e) Vouchers may only be used once. Where you cancel any subsequent bookings, you must have selected the Standard Flexible Booking option for those bookings in order for your deposit(s) to be protected and added back to your Hostelworld account as a voucher.
(f) Vouchers only apply to deposits for accommodation bookings; it cannot be used in respect of other charges levied via the Hostelworld Sites - e.g. booking fees or other purchases.
(g) In the event of a no-show without cancellation (or where insufficient notice is given of a cancellation in accordance with these and/or the travel services provider's terms and conditions), all deposits, including deposits paid through the Standard Flexible Booking option, will be non-refundable and the travel services provider will have the right to charge your credit card on the basis set out in clause 3.7. (above).
</p>

<p>3.14 Where you make a Free Cancellation Booking, the following provisions will apply:
(a) If you cancel your booking prior to the time and date notified to you as part of the booking process, and as set out in your booking confirmation, your deposit payment will be refunded to the payment method you used to make your booking within a commercially reasonable period of time from the date of the cancellation.
(b) Your refund will be processed in the original currency that you used to pay the deposit. For example, if you paid the deposit in Euro the deposit will be refunded in Euro. The travel services provider and Hostelworld are not responsible for the exchange rate imposed by your payment service provider, or any charges that they may apply to convert the refunded amount into your local currency.
(c) In order to claim the refund, you must process your cancellation online through the cancellation function available on the Hostelworld Sites.
(d) If it is not possible to refund your deposit using the payment method you used at the time of booking (e.g. because your card has expired), Hostelworld’s customer services department will contact you to arrange a refund by alternative means. If you do not provide details of a valid bank account within 30 days of the request to provide such details, you will forfeit your right to receive a refund of your deposit.
(e) It is only possible to receive a refund of your deposit if you cancel your full booking (partial cancellations, such as cancellations of 1 night of a 2 night stay, will not result in a refund of any portion of your deposit).
(f) For the avoidance of doubt, We refund your deposit on behalf of the relevant travel services provider as their agent. We do not act on your behalf when processing refunds.
</p>

<p>Tour Bookings</p>
<p>3.15 Where you make a tour or experience booking, the following provisions apply:
(a) Your booking cannot be changed by you or cancelled with a refund, unless otherwise stated in the terms and conditions applicable to such tour or experience as set by the travel service provider and/or the tour/experience aggregator. In all circumstances, you must check the cancellation policy contained in the applicable tour/experience operator listing at the time of your booking, which is the policy that will apply to and govern the terms of your cancellation and any refunds.
(b) The tour/experience aggregator’s (e.g. Viator) standard cancellation policy may allow you to request a change to and/or cancel a tour/experience booking up until 24 hours before the start time of the tour/experience; or if the tour/experience does not have an explicit start time, the deadline to request a change or to cancel will generally be 11:59pm, two days before the start date. Timings are calculated in accordance with the time zone of the tour/experience.
(c) Notwithstanding clauses 3.15(a) and (b), requests for cancellations to a tour/experience booking can only be made through Our customer service team at <a href="customerservice@hostelworld.com">customerservice@hostelworld.com</a>. Please note that a travel service provider or tour/experience aggregator (e.g. Viator) may charge a fee to cancel a booking; in such circumstances, you will be required to pay such fee in order that Hostelworld may successfully process your cancellation.

All cancellations will be communicated by Us to the tour/experience aggregator (e.g. Viator) who will process the cancellation subject to the availability and agreement of the applicable travel service provider. Hostelworld does not guarantee the success of any cancellation. Your right to a refund (if any) shall be governed by the cancellation terms of your booking. All requests for modifications and amendments to your booking, including date change requests, must be made directly to the travel service provider. Hostelworld does not process any requests to modify or amend a booking.
</p>

<p>3.16 The deposit and the booking fee that you pay will be payable in the currency that you select as your "settlement currency" when making your booking. Where the accommodation or tour/experience price was uploaded by the travel services provider in a different currency, the deposit amount that you will be charged in your settlement currency will be calculated by converting the deposit price into your settlement currency using Hostelworld’s standard exchange rates.</p>

<p>Payment Platforms</p>
<p>3.17 From time to time, We may make available an online payment platform (“OPP”), giving you the ability to make online payments to travel service providers via Worldpay, Stripe, credit card, debit card, or other payment options. We may change or withdraw such OPP at any time without notice and at Our sole discretion. We will provide you as much notice as possible about such changes but We are not required to do so. If you are directed to a third-party payment processor or payment provider such as Worldpay or Stripe, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party's service, including applicable fees, as well as that third party's personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and Our <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/securityprivacy.php">Data Protection Notice</a> before using such services.</p>
<p>3.18 We are not responsible for the payment solutions enabled on Our OPP or for any decision taken by a payment provider to decline your payment, based on its risk assessment of you or that transaction. You agree that We are not liable for any losses you suffer as a result of making a payment to travel services provider via the OPP. If you need customer support in relation to an online payment, you should contact the payment provider or Your bank or payment card provider.</p>
<p>Chargebacks</p>
<p>3.19 Chargebacks occur when your payment card provider makes a demand to Us to return monies on a transaction which you claim is fraudulent or otherwise disputed. Chargebacks may happen for a variety of valid reasons but if you make a payment-card payment to Us in respect of a booking, and you later dispute this legitimate charge by raising a chargeback without merit, whether fraudulently or otherwise, then We may take steps to recover any charges resulting from such an unmerited chargeback from you directly. We take a zero-tolerance approach to chargeback fraud.

Unmerited chargebacks in Our view include, but are not limited to: (i) disputing a charge made in accordance with the travel services providers cancellation policy; (ii) disputing a charge made by a travel services providers where you fail to make reasonable efforts to work with the travel services providers or Us to resolve any issues; (iii) disputing a charge made in respect of a booking which was modified by you and the travel services providers in breach of these Terms; or (iv) requesting a chargeback without a legitimate reason and/or failing to provide any supporting information in respect of the chargeback to allow the travel services providers or Us to assess the basis of the chargeback request.

Hostelworld does not compensate or otherwise reward a customer for completing a Review.

                            <h3>11. Passports, Visas and Insurance</h3>
<p>11.1 When you make a booking, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order.</p>
<p>11.2 For applicable passport and visa requirements, you should consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Such requirements may change at any time, and it is your responsibility to check for up-to-date information before making a booking and before your departure. Hostelworld accepts no liability in connection with any person who is refused entry onto a flight or into any country, including countries such person may just be passing through en route to their destination.</p>
<p>11.3 As visa and health requirements are subject to change without notice, Hostelworld recommends that you verify health and visa requirements with the appropriate consulate prior to departure. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip.</p>
<p>11.4 Hostelworld strongly recommends that you purchase a comprehensive travel insurance policy prior to departure. If you cancel your booking or significantly alter travel dates, your travel insurance policy may reimburse the cost of cancellation fees and related expenses. Please review your travel insurance policy carefully for related terms and conditions.</p>
<p>11.5 Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. Hostelworld urges customers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories issued by the Irish Government and destination country governments prior to booking travel to international destinations. Information on conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international destinations can be found www.dfa.ie/travel. Hostelworld does not warrant or represent that travel to any destination is advisable or without risk, and Hostelworld is not liable for any damages or losses that may result from travel to such destinations.</p>
                            <h3>12. General</h3>

<p>12.1 These Terms are drafted in the English language. If these Terms are translated into any other language, the English language version shall prevail</p>
<p>12.2 Our failure to enforce at any time or for any period any one or more of the Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of them or the rights attaching to any of them.</p>
<p>12.3 These Terms and the <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/securityprivacy.php">Data Protection Notice</a> constitute the entire agreement between you and Hostelworld in relation to the subject matter of these Terms and the <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/securityprivacy.php">Data Protection Notice</a> and supersede any previous agreements or representations between the parties relating to the subject matter of this agreement.</p>
<p>12.4 We reserve the right to update or otherwise modify these Terms as well as the contents of the Hostelworld Sites at any time and for any reason and without liability to you, any other user or any third party. You understand and agree that your continued access or use of the Hostelworld Sites after such change signifies your acceptance of the updated Terms. This right shall not affect the Terms accepted by you upon making a legitimate booking or purchase using the Hostelworld Sites. We will note the date that updates were last made to the Terms at the top of this page, and the updated Terms will take effect upon posting. It is your responsibility to check these Terms each time you access the Hostelworld Sites to review the most current version of these Terms.</p>
<p>12.5 These Terms and your use of the Hostelworld Sites are governed by the laws of Ireland. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Irish courts in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Hostelworld Sites each time you access the Hostelworld Sites. Use of the Hostelworld Sites is not authorised in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms including, without limitation, this clause.</p>
<p>12.6 Our performance of these Terms is subject to existing laws and legal process and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Our right to comply with law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Hostelworld Sites or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use.</p>
<p>12.7 If any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed to be superseded by any such valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in effect.</p>
<p>12.8 Although We cannot monitor the conduct of Our users offsite, it shall be a breach of these Terms to use any information obtained from the Hostelworld Sites in order to harass, abuse or harm other persons, or in order to contact, advertise to, solicit or sell to any user or person without their prior express consent.</p>
<p>12.9 While Our terms require that travel services providers display prices which are inclusive of all value added and other additional taxes, the price displayed is ultimately the responsibility of the travel services provider rather than ours. You acknowledge that We shall not have liability to you in respect of any attempt by travel services provider to levy additional value added or other taxes on you at the point of payment as a supplement to the price displayed and your sole recourse in this regard will be against the travel services provider.</p>
<p>12.10 The Hostelworld Sites may contain translations powered by Google. Google disclaims all warranties related to the translations, express or implied, including any warranties or accuracy, reliability and any implied warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. </p>
