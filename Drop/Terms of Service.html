<h3 id="order-processing">Order Processing</h3>
<p>Drop may, in its sole discretion, choose to not process or to cancel your order in certain circumstances. This may occur, for example, when the product or service you wish to purchase is out of stock or has been mispriced, we suspect the request is fraudulent, or in other circumstances Drop deems appropriate in its sole discretion. Drop also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take steps to verify your identity to process your order. Drop will either not charge you or refund the charges for orders that we do not process or cancel.</p>
<h3 id="product-and-service-descriptions">Product and Service Descriptions</h3>
<p>Drop strives to provide accurate descriptions of products and services on the Drop Sites. Drop does not guarantee, however, that the descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. If a product or service offered on the Drop Sites is not as described, your sole remedy is to return the item.</p>
<h3 id="cosmetic-and-beauty">Cosmetic and Beauty</h3>
<p>All material and information presented by Drop with respect to any cosmetic products are intended to be used for personal informational purposes only. You may not sell or resell any products you purchase or otherwise receive from Drop. While Drop has tried to accurately display the colors of products, the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor and monitor settings and may not be accurate.
Drop is not the manufacturer of the cosmetic products it sells and shall not be bound by any errors or omissions in posting product information or prices with respect to any products or services offered on the Site.

<p>Please consult with your own physician or health care practitioner regarding any suggestions and recommendations made on our Site or by any cosmetic manufacturer and always check the ingredients for products to avoid potential allergic reactions. If any minor uses any goods or product from Drop it should be only after the legal or parental guardian has discussed the product with the minor&#39;s doctor.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE IN NEED OF MEDICAL ATTENTION, CALL 911 OR YOUR PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY.</p>
<h3 id="pricing-information">Pricing Information</h3>
<p>Drop strives to provide accurate pricing information regarding the products and services available on the Drop Sites. We cannot, however, insure against pricing errors. Drop reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to not process or to cancel any orders placed for a product or service whose price was incorrectly posted on the site as a result of an error. If this occurs, Drop will notify you by email. In addition, Drop reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to correct any error in the stated full retail price.</p>
<h2 id="return-policy">RETURN POLICY</h2>
<p>Free returns and exchanges are accepted within the US on select Drop-branded products. US customers may return or exchange these items in new, unused condition within 30 days of delivery by contacting Drop Support. Eligible products will have a “Free Returns &amp; Exchanges” note at the bottom of the product listing page.</p>
<p>For all other products, we only offer returns/replacement for items that arrive damaged, defective, not as advertised, or missing components. When third-party runs are completed, we submit the group&#39;s order to the vendor up front. This is how we’re able to deliver the best value to our members and is also why all sales are final. In the event that a product arrives damaged, defective, not as advertised, or missing components, please contact Drop Support.</p>

<h2 id="modification-of-terms-of-service">MODIFICATION OF TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that Drop may, in its sole discretion, modify, add or remove any portion of these Terms of Service at any time and in any manner, including the terms of Drop membership, by posting revised Terms of Service on the Site.
