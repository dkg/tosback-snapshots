<p><em>Personal information we collect from third parties</em></p>
<p>2.6 From time to time, we may receive information about you from third parties and other users:</p>
<p><strong>Information obtained from third parties.</strong> We may obtain information from third parties to enhance or supplement our existing user information. We may also collect information about you that is publicly available. We may combine this information with the information we collect from you directly. For example, we may obtain information when you log in through a third-party social network or authentication service, such as Facebook or Google.</p>
<p><strong>Information provided by social networks you connect to our Service.</strong> If you connect a social network, such as Facebook, to our Service we will collect personal information from the social network in accordance with your privacy settings on that social network. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, which could include your name, email address, address book and contacts, or other information.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you interact with us through a social media site or third-party service, such as when you like, follow, or share our content on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, or other sites, we may receive information from the social network, including your profile information, picture, user ID associated with your social media account, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties.</p>

<p>5.4 We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with applicable law and this privacy policy.</p>
<p>5.5 <a href="https://drop.com/privacy#privacy-shield-addendum">Privacy Shield.</a> We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information received from European Union countries and Switzerland (the &quot;<strong>Privacy Shield</strong>&quot;). We have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity, purpose limitation, access, and recourse, enforcement and liability (&quot;<strong>Principles</strong>&quot;).

<h2 id="7-california-residents-your-california-privacy-rights">7. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS - YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</h2>
<p>7.1 This section applies to you if you are a resident of the state of California. This section provides additional details about the personal information we collect about California consumers and the rights afforded to them under the California Consumer Privacy Act or “CCPA.” For purposes of this section, “personal information” has the meaning provided by the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) and does not include information that is publicly available, that is deidentified or aggregated such that it is not capable of being associated with us, or that is excluded from the CCPA’s scope, such as personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, such as the HIPAA, the FCRA, GLBA or the Driver&#39;s Privacy Protection Act of 1994. This section does not apply to information relating to our employees, contractors, applicants and other personnel.</p>
<p>7.2 Collection and use of Personal Information. For more details about the personal information we have collected over the last 12 months, including the categories of sources, please see the Personal Information We Collect About You And How We Use It section above. We collect this information for the business and commercial purposes described in the same, Personal Information We Collect About You And How We Use It section above. We share this information with the categories of third parties described in the Recipients Of Your Personal Information section above. We do not sell (as such term is defined in the CCPA) the personal information we collect (and will not sell it without providing a right to opt out). Please note that we do use third-party cookies for our advertising purposes as further described in the Cookies And Similar Technologies and Interest Based Advertising section below.</p>
<p>In the last 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) Identifiers, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, or other similar identifiers;</p>
<p>(b) California customer records, such as payment information;</p>
<p>(c) Commercial information, such as records of services purchased, obtained or considered;</p>
<p>(d) Internet/Network information, such as device information, logs and analytics data;</p>
<p>(e) Geolocation data, such as precise location data from your device or generated based on your IP address; and</p>
<p>(f) Inferences about your interests and preferences, generated from your use of our sites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We collect this information directly from you, from our business partners and affiliates, from your browser or device when you visit our websites, or from third parties that you permit to share information with us.</p>
<p>7.3 Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California consumers the right to request to know more details about the categories or specific pieces of personal information we collect (including how we use and disclose this information), to delete their personal information, to opt out of any “sales” that may be occurring, and to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights.</p>
<p>7.4 Disclosure of Personal Information. We share personal information with the categories of third parties described in the Recipients Of Your Personal Information section above. We do not “sell” personal information as most people would typically understand that term. However, we do allow certain third-party partners and providers to collect information about consumers directly through our services for purposes of analyzing and optimizing our services, delivering ads, providing content and ads that are more relevant, measuring statistics and the success of ad campaigns, and detecting and reporting fraud. To the extent this practice is interpreted to constitute a “sale” under the CCPA, please see our Cookies And Similar Technologies and Interest Based Advertising section below for more information including how to exercise your rights to opt-out of cookies, analytics and personalized advertising.</p>
<p>7.5 California consumers may make a request pursuant to their rights under the CCPA by contacting us at <a href="https://drop.com/support">Drop Support</a>. We will verify your request using the information associated with your account, including email address. Government identification may be required.</p>
<p>7.6 Your Rights and Choices. Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides California consumers the following rights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) The Right to Know any or all of the following information relating to your personal information we have collected and disclosed in the last 12 months, upon verification of your identity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you;</p>
<p>(ii) The categories of personal information we have collected about you;</p>
<p>(iii) The categories of sources of the personal information;</p>
<p>(iv) The categories of personal information that we have disclosed to third parties for a business purpose, and the categories of recipients to whom this information was disclosed;</p>
<p>(v) The categories of personal information we have sold and the categories of third parties to whom the information was sold; and</p>
<p>(vi) The business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling the personal information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(b) The Right to Request Deletion of personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.</p>
<p>(c) The Right to Opt Out of Personal Information Sales to third parties now or in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You also have the right to be free of discrimination for exercising these rights. However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.</p>
<p>7.7 To Submit Your California Consumer Rights Requests. You may submit a request to exercise your California Consumer Rights through one of the mechanisms described below. We will need to verify your identity before processing your request, which may require us to request additional personal information from you or require you to log into your account, if you have one. In certain circumstances, we may decline or limit your request, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems, or as permitted by law.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) To exercise your Right to Know, please submit a request via <a href="https://drop.com/support">Drop Support</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@drop.com">privacy@drop.com</a>.</p>
<p>(b) To exercise your Right to Request Deletion, please submit a request via <a href="https://drop.com/support">Drop Support</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@drop.com">privacy@drop.com</a>.</p>
<p>(c) To opt out or control the use of your personal information by social media, advertising and analytics partners, please see Cookies And Similar Technologies and Interest Based Advertising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>7.8 Minors. We do not sell the personal information of consumers we know to be less than 16 years of age, unless we receive affirmative authorization (the &quot;Right to Opt In&quot;) from either the minor who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a minor less than 13 years of age. Please contact us via <a href="https://drop.com/support">Drop Support</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@drop.com">privacy@drop.com</a> to inform us if you, or your minor child, are under the age of 16. If you are under the age of 18 and you want to remove your name or comments from our website or publicly displayed content, please contact us directly via <a href="https://drop.com/support">Drop Support</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@drop.com">privacy@drop.com</a>. We may not be able to modify or delete your information in all circumstances.</p>
<p>7.9 <strong>Do Not Track Signals.</strong> California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser &quot;Do Not Track&quot; (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn&#39;t an industry or legal standard to recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don&#39;t respond to them at this time. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com/">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>

<h2 id="8-interest-based-advertising">8. INTEREST BASED ADVERTISING</h2>
<p>8.1 We participate in interest-based advertising and use third party advertising companies to serve you targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. We permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third party services to collect information about your use of our Service over time so that they may play or display ads on our Service, on other websites, apps or services you may use, and on other devices you may use.</p>
<p>8.2 Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies.

<p>8.3 We may also use certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Universal Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting.

You must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.</p>
