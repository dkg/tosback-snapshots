<h1>Backblaze Terms of Service</h1>
Last Updated: February 12, 2021
<br>
<br>
Welcome to Backblaze! Thank you for using our service. We’re glad you’re here.
<br>
<br>
These Terms of Service ("Terms") apply to your use of Backblaze's website, products, and services.
Please read them carefully and let us know if you have any questions.
<br>
<br>
By using Backblaze, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you're using Backblaze on behalf of an
organization, you agree to these Terms on behalf of that organization.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Content</h4>
All content on Backblaze is protected by intellectual property laws. You'll find a few different types
of content on our service.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Your Files</h4>
You can back up, host, store, and share your own files on Backblaze. The materials you upload to
Backblaze are yours and yours alone. You give us permission to use that material solely to do what's
necessary to provide our services, including storing, displaying, reproducing, and distributing those
materials.
<br>
<br>
We don't sell the files you store with us to third parties, and we don't use them for advertising
 purposes. We can disclose your files only in the limited circumstances described in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Notice</a>.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Your Responsibilities</h4>
Your use of our services must comply with our Terms and applicable Backblaze policies, as well as
applicable law, including export control laws and regulations, privacy laws, intellectual property laws
and other third party legal rights. You are solely responsible for the development, content, and use of
the files you upload to Backblaze and you assume all risks associated with them, including intellectual
property or other legal claims. By storing files with Backblaze, you represent that you have all
necessary rights to store, use and, if applicable, publicize that material, and that doing so does not
conflict with, violate or misappropriate any third party legal rights, conflict with licenses you've
granted to others, violate any applicable law or regulations, or any of our Terms or applicable
Backblaze policies.
<br>
<br>
Our services will allow you to share your files with others, which is in your sole control and
discretion. You are responsible for taking appropriate steps to secure and protect your account and your
files, such as setting up and maintaining the proper configuration and use of our services, as well as
using encryption to protect your files from unauthorized access when and if applicable. Please be
careful about what files you choose to share. Backblaze doesn't actively monitor the files you upload,
download or share. However, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to remove files you store with
Backblaze and/or suspend your access to your account in the event we become aware that your use of our
services or files violate any of Backblaze’s Terms or applicable policies, or any applicable law and/or
regulations, such as copyright infringement, we learn the material is patently unlawful, we learn the
material is malware or supports the distribution of malware, etc. We assume no liability for any
content that you or anyone else stores with Backblaze.
<br>
<br>
All of the information that you provide as part of the account registration and setup, and on-going use
of the account, is accurate, complete and authorized by the account holder.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Backblaze's Content and Brand Features</h4>
Backblaze is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. Backblaze gives you a personal,
worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software we provide you to
use our service. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use Backblaze as permitted by
these Terms. If you violate these Terms, we may terminate this license.
<br>
<br>
All rights to Backblaze —except third-party content—are the exclusive property of Backblaze and its
licensors. Nothing in these Terms authorizes you to use any of Backblaze trademarks, logos, domain
names, or other distinctive brand features except as otherwise permitted by law.
<br>
<br>
<h4> Prohibited Activities</h4>
Backblaze strives to maintain a great service. To that end, we require you to comply with certain
limitations, and we may suspend or terminate your account if you use our service in a manner that
violates our Terms or applicable policies, including but not limited to the following:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>violate any laws, regulations, ordinances, or directives.</li>
<li>do anything threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, tortious, or invasive of another person's privacy.</li>
<li>harass or abuse Backblaze personnel or representatives or agents performing services on behalf
of Backblaze.</li>
<li>store or use our services in any way, including by hosting or sending files, in support of
malware, phishing, spam, and similar activities.</li>
<li>interfere with the proper functioning of any software, hardware, or equipment on Backblaze.</li>
<li>engage in any conduct that inhibits anyone else's use or enjoyment of our services, or which we
determine may harm Backblaze or our users.</li>
<li>monitor or copy any material on Backblaze, either manually or through automated means (i.e.,
scraping), without prior written consent from Backblaze.</li>
<li>circumvent, or attempt to circumvent, storage space limits or pricing.</li>
<li>use the Backblaze system in a manner inconsistent with its intended manner or purpose.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Our Rights</h4>
We're always working to improve Backblaze and make our services better, so we do reserve some rights. In
our sole discretion, we may, at any time—with or without notice—change, eliminate or restrict access to
our services, and modify, suspend, or terminate a user account. If you stop paying for our service or
violate any of our Terms or applicable policies, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your
account and may delete your data. Backblaze is not liable for any damages as a result of these actions.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Beta Services</h4>
We sometimes release products and features that we’re still testing and evaluating (“Beta Services”).
Beta Services are labeled “alpha,” “beta,” “preview,” “early access,” or “evaluation” (or with words or
phrases with similar meanings) and may not be as reliable as Backblaze’s other services. Beta Services
are made available in part so that we can collect user feedback, and by using our Beta Services, you
agree that we may contact you to collect such feedback. Beta Services are confidential until official
launch. If you use any Beta Services, you agree not to disclose any information about those Services to
anyone else without our permission.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Other Sites and Services</h4>
Backblaze may contain links to websites, services, and advertisements that we neither own nor control.
We don't endorse or assume responsibility for any third-party sites, information, materials, products,
or services.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
Our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="dpa.html">Data Processing Agreement</a>
governs our collection and use of your personal information. Please review those provisions, too. You
represent to us that you have provided all necessary privacy notices and obtained all necessary
consents. You are responsible for the storage and use of your files in accordance with applicable data
privacy laws.

our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.

<h4>Using Backblaze in an Organization</h4>
If you set up Backblaze for a business, organization, or other group, you must operate your account
consistent with your group's policies. If you are using a Backblaze service set up by a group
administrator, that administrator may be able to access, restrict, terminate, or remove information from
your Backblaze account.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Account Creation and Access</h4>
When you create a Backblaze account you will be required to set your account credentials – an email
address and a password that you choose. You may optionally configure a second factor on your account,
such as SMS messaging, a Private Encryption Key for your computer backup, or backup codes. You are
responsible for accurately maintaining and safeguarding your account credentials, including the devices,
keys, codes, etc. used for the second factor if you choose to use one.
one.
<br>
<br>
To log in to your account and access your files you will be required to provide valid account
credentials, including any second factor you had previously configured. Backblaze is under no obligation
to provide you access to your account or your files if you are unable to provide the appropriate account
credentials including any second factor you have configured.
<br>
<br>

You can cancel your Backblaze service and then delete your Backblaze account any time you'd like by
simply signing-in to your account. To cancel your Backblaze service, you will be required to log in to
your account and delete all of your files stored on our system. Please visit our help center at
help.backblaze.com if assistance is needed to cancel your service and delete your account.
<br>
<br>
When you cancel your Backblaze service, we will no longer bill you for the Backblaze account you have
cancelled, except for past due amounts. Your cancelled account information will remain accessible unless
you delete your account. When you delete your account, your account information (email address, for
example) will be removed from our active system and you will no longer be able to access your account.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Disclaimers</h4>
Backblaze is provided "as is" without any warranties, express or implied. Except where otherwise
prohibited by law, Backblaze disclaims all warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, and non-infringement. (Some states don't allow these disclaimers, so this provision
might not apply to you.)
<br>
<br>
<h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
To the fullest extent allowed by law, Backblaze shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred
directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from
(A) your access to, use of, inability to access, or inability to use Backblaze; (B) any third party
conduct or content on Backblaze, including any defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of third
parties; or (C) any unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your content.(Some states don't allow
these limitations, so this provision might not apply to you.)
<br>
<br>
<h4>Arbitration and Opt Out</h4>
We'd like to resolve any disputes fairly and quickly. Toward that end, if you have any issue with
Backblaze, please contact us and we'll work with you in good faith to try to resolve the matter.
<br>
<br>
If we can't solve the dispute informally, and if you are a resident of or have your principal place of
business in the United States or Canada, you and Backblaze agree to resolve any claim against each other
through final and binding arbitration, including claims against Backblaze affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and agents, and Backblaze affiliates' officers, directors, employees and agents.
<br>
<br>
You and Backblaze agree to submit the dispute to a single arbitrator under the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) including the Optional Rules for Emergency Measures
of Protection and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, or, by separate mutual
agreement, to another arbitration institution. The AAA's rules and a description of the arbitration
process are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>. The location of the arbitration
and the allocation of fees and costs shall be determined under the AAA rules, except that Backblaze will
reimburse you for all AAA administrative fees in disputes that are subject to the Supplementary
Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, unless the arbitrator determines that a claim or counterclaim
was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.
<br>
<br>
The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and
reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed
$75,000, Backblaze will pay for all reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees, as long as
the arbitrator determines that your claim is non-frivolous. Any judgment on the award rendered by the
arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
<br>
<br>
The Federal Arbitration Act governs all disputes between you and Backblaze. The arbitrator will decide
 whether a dispute can be arbitrated.
<br>
<br>
If you opt out of the arbitration agreement (as provided below), or if the arbitration agreement is
found to be unenforceable, or if you neither are a resident nor have a principal place of business in
the United States or Canada, you agree to resolve any claim you have with Backblaze exclusively in a
state or federal court located in the City and County of San Francisco, California, and to submit to the
personal jurisdiction of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California for
purpose of litigating all such disputes.
<br>
<br>
Nothing shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for
matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the services.
<br>
<br>
To the extent permitted by law, you agree to file any claim you may have against Backblaze within one
year after such claim arose. Otherwise, your claim is permanently barred.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Class Action and Trial Waiver</h4>
You and Backblaze agree that each party may bring disputes against the other only in an individual
capacity and not on behalf of any class of people. You and Backblaze agree not to participate in a class
action, a class-wide arbitration, claims brought in a representative capacity, or consolidated claims
involving another person's account. You and Backblaze agree not to combine a claim subject to
arbitration under this agreement with a claim that is not eligible for arbitration under this agreement.
You and Backblaze agree to waive the right to a trial by jury for all disputes.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Your Right to Opt Out of Arbitration</h4>
You may opt out of the agreement to arbitrate. If you do so, neither you nor Backblaze can require the
other to participate in an arbitration proceeding. To opt out, you must notify Backblaze within 90 days
of the date that you first agreed to these Terms. To opt out by mail, send your written opt-out notice
to this address:
<br>
<br>
Backblaze, Inc.
<br>
c/o Arbitration Opt-Out
<br>
500 Ben Franklin Ct
<br>
San Mateo, CA 94401
<br>
<br>
Your written opt-out notice must include (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address
associated with your account; (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration
agreement; (4) date sent, and (5) your signature.
<br>
<br>
Alternatively, you can opt out online by fully sending an email with the above information to:
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="721e1715131e3210131119101e1308175c111d1f5c">[email&#160;protected]</a>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Indemnification</h4>
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Backblaze from and against all liabilities, damages,
and costs (including settlement costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of any claim by a
third party against Backblaze and its affiliates regarding (a) files stored with us by you or your
users, (b) your domains, or (c) your or your users’ use of Backblaze in violation of these terms.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, except for its conflict of laws
principles.
<br>
<br>
For claims that aren't subject to arbitration, we each agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a
state court located in San Francisco County, California or in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Entire Agreement</h4>
These Terms, our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, and our <a href="payments-and-refunds.html">Payment and Refunds page</a> constitute the entire agreement
between you and Backblaze. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining
provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
<br>
<br>
<h4>No Waiver</h4>
No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be a further or continuing waiver of that term.
Backblaze's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of
that right or provision.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Modification</h4>
The Terms may be modified from time to time. The date of the most recent revisions will always be at <a href="terms.html">http://www.backblaze.com/terms</a>. If we make changes that we believe will
substantially alter your rights, we will notify you. If you continue to use Backblaze after
modifications of the Terms, by doing so you agree to accept such modifications.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Contact</h4>
We welcome all questions, concerns, and feedback you might have about these terms. If you have
suggestions for us, let us know at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="49252c2e2825092b282a222b2528332c672a262467">[email&#160;protected]</a>
