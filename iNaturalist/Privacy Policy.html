<p>
  This Privacy Policy is subject to Our Terms of Service at <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/terms">https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/terms</a>.  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, as specified in the “Changes to This Privacy Policy” section below.  
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="consent" href="#consent" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="icon-link"></i></a>
  Your Consent
</h3>

<p>
  You should read this entire Privacy Policy before submitting information to Us or using Our Websites.  Whenever You submit personal and non-personal information via Our Websites or otherwise to Us, whether online or offline, You consent to the collection, use disclosure, transfer, and storage of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="types" href="#types" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="icon-link"></i></a>
  Types of Information We Collect
</h3>

<p>
  "Personal Information" means information such as Your first/middle initial or name, last name, e-mail address, street address, mailing address if different, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, profile photograph, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, credit card information and any other information that could allow someone to identify You or contact You, including information collected through cookies and other technology.
</p>

<p>
  iNaturalist collects Personal Information of the sort that web browsers, hardware, software and servers typically make available, such as the IP address, device ID, browser type, language preference, referring site, pages viewed, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, and the date and time of each visitor request.  iNaturalist's purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how iNaturalist's visitors use its Websites and Apps.  From time to time, iNaturalist may release such information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Websites and Apps.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="collect" href="#collect" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="icon-link"></i></a>
  How We Collect Personal Information
</h3>

<p>
  iNaturalist may collect Personal Information when You choose to interact with iNaturalist in ways that require iNaturalist to gather such information, such as if You browse on iNaturalist, register as an iNaturalist User, update or add information to Your iNaturalist profile, provide content to iNaturalist through Your computer or phone, make a donation to iNaturalist through the Websites, make a purchase from the iNaturalist store (collectively, the iNaturalist "Services"), or otherwise communicate or engage with Us about the iNaturalist Services. When You post an Observation on iNaturalist, We may collect Your User ID, latitude and longitude of the site of the Observation, the place name of the site of the Observation, the date and time of the Observation, the metadata associated with image or sound files, the app You used to contribute data, and the time zone of the site of the Observation.  The amount and type of information that iNaturalist gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.  In each case, iNaturalist collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of Your interaction with iNaturalist.  iNaturalist does not disclose Personal Information other than as described herein.  You can refuse to supply Personal Information, with the caveat that doing so may prevent You from engaging in certain Website and App-related activities, such as registering as an iNaturalist User, maintaining an iNaturalist profile, or posting content to iNaturalist.  Without providing personal information (other than the automatic provision of Your IP address), You will still be able to access and use iNaturalist on a read-only basis.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="use" href="#use" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="icon-link"></i></a>
  How We Use Personal Information
</h3>

<p>
  We may use the Personal Information that You provide in order to deliver the iNaturalist Services and to administer and maintain the iNaturalist Websites, respond to Your inquiries, improve our services, business, and Websites, manage our business including spam detection and fraud prevention purposes, for marketing, legal and research purposes, and to understand how You use Our Websites and services.  If You register as an iNaturalist User, You must give Us current, complete and accurate information and keep the information You provide to Us up to date. We cannot and shall not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if You do not give Us current, accurate, truthful, or complete information or if You fail to update the information You give Us. 
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="disclose" href="#disclose" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><i class="icon-link"></i></a>
  When We Disclose and Share Personal Information
</h3>

<p>
  Personal Information You provide related to the Observations You post (user name, date, time, location) is published in venues on iNaturalist where it is visible to anyone ("Published") as matter of normal usage and therefore is publicly shared with other iNaturalist Users, whether or not they are signed in. We also explicitly and publicly share this information publicly in a machine-readable format with a handful of partners, including the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ("GBIF").
</p>

<p>
  We share Personal Information associated with Users’ registration and account (IP address, email address, etc.) with representatives from iNaturalist Network Members (see https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/network for information about the iNaturalist Network). iNaturalist Network Members can request and receive Personal Information from Users who affiliate with their particular Member site as their primary site.
</p>

<p>
  iNaturalist discloses Personal Information to contractors, service providers, consultants and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on iNaturalist's behalf or to provide Services available at iNaturalist's Websites and Apps, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others, with the exception of non-public location data from Observations for non-commercial research, conservation, and species management purposes.
</p>

<p>
  Some of those contractors, service providers and affiliated organizations may be located outside of Your home country; by using iNaturalist's Websites or Apps, You consent to the transfer of such information to them. iNaturalist will not rent or sell Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal information with entities that support Our business and operations such as hosting Our Websites and data, communicating with You, fraud and spam detection, data analytics, and other legitimate business purposes including communicating with the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, Google Analytics, Google Firebase and New Relic.
</p>

<p>
  We use Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, Google Maps Platform (to display geographic content), and SendGrid.  If You choose to participate in some optional services, We will share Personal Information with entities that make those services possible, such as Civilized Discourse Construction Kit (for the iNaturalist Forum); Donorbox and Stripe (for charitable donations); and Shopify, Printify and TaxJar (for the iNaturalist Store).
</p>

<p>
  Other than as described above, iNaturalist discloses Personal Information only when required to do so by law, or when iNaturalist believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of iNaturalist, third parties, or the public at large. Unless authorized by You through Your opt-in, or as provided above, We will make Your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties only in the following circumstances:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If We are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court, or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process);
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If We believe Your actions violate a law, regulation, this Privacy Policy, or any applicable website or app's terms of use, or if You threaten the rights, property or safety of Us, Our Websites, Our Apps, any other Users, or third party;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If, in Our sole discretion, We believe disclosure is necessary to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect Our assets, to defend Our interests or comply with Our legal and regulatory obligations; or to protect a User's safety;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If there is a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving iNaturalist, the Academy or National Geographic.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If You are a registered User of iNaturalist and have supplied Your email address, iNaturalist may occasionally send You an email to tell You about new features, solicit Your feedback, or just keep You up to date with what's going on with iNaturalist and Our services. We primarily use blogs and groups to communicate this type of information, so We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If You send Us a request (for example via a support email or via one of Our feedback mechanisms), We reserve the right to publish it in order to help Us clarify or respond to Your request or to help Us support other Users. iNaturalist takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of Personal Information.

  Legal Basis for Processing Personal Information Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
</h3>

<p>
  If You are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), iNaturalist's legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described in this Privacy Policy depends on the Personal Information We collect and the specific context in which We collect it. In addition, We process Personal Information with the principle of data minimization in mind. This means that We limit ourselves to the minimum amount of personal information which is needed to achieve the particular purpose for which We process the Personal Information. Below are some examples of the purposes for which Personal Information may be processed. 
</p>

<p>
  iNaturalist may process Your Personal Information because:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      The processing is necessary to provide the services and features You have requested
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The processing is necessary to perform a contract with You
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      The processing is necessary for the legitimate interests of Our business, such as fraud prevention, information security, or to comply with the law
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      You have provided consent for Us to do so.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
