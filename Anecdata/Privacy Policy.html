<h1>
Anecdata is upgrading!
</h1>

<p>
	Hi everyone! It's Cait here, development lead for Anecdata. We're moving the site to a new server. Hang tight while we introduce some cool new features (like emoji support!)
</p>

<p>
	We expect this upgrade to be done by Wednesday, March 31st.
</p>


<p>
	In the meantime... March 31st is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Transgender_Day_of_Visibility">Transgender Day of Visibility!</a> As a transgender woman, I'd like to take this opportunity to show some support to my trans siblings!
