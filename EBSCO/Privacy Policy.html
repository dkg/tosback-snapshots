      Services
      collects information that does not directly reveal your identity or does
      not
      directly relate to an identifiable individual. This may include a unique
      identifier (unconnected to an individual’s Personal Information) and
      related
      analytics and usage information that we use to track usage of our
      Services,
      track trends in our Services, administer the Services, and improve our
      users’
      experience.&nbsp;</p>

    <a name="prod_how-do-we-collect-info"></a>
    <p>
      <strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; How Do We Collect the Information?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>The categories of sources from which we collect Personal Information are
      described in the
      <a href="#pi_categories">table</a> above.</p>

    <p>We only collect and use Personal Information when you voluntarily provide
      it
      to us or when an institutional customer provides it to us in connection
      with
      its method of authenticating users for access to our Services, with the
      exception of your IP address, geolocation, and certain device information
      which may be automatically captured when you access our Services.</p>

    <p>If you provide us Personal Information about others, or if others give us
      your Personal Information, we will only use that information for the
      specific
      reason for which it was provided to us.</p>

    <p>In order to use some of the unique functions within our Services, a user
      must
      first complete a registration form or provide an email address that will
      require the user’s disclosure of limited Personal Information. Such
      disclosure
      is strictly voluntary.</p>

    <p>Because of how email communication works, you will have to disclose an
      email
      address to us if you choose to contact us or communicate with us by email.
    </p>

    <p>We automatically collect non-Personal Information generated from your use
      of
      our Services. We use this non-Personal Information in the aggregate. We do
      not
      combine these types of non-Personal Information with Personal Information.

    <p>
      <strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; How Do We Use the Information?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>The business or commercial purpose(s) for which Personal Information is
      collected is described in the
      <a href="#pi_categories">table</a> above.</p>

    <p>We use the Personal Information we collect for the limited purposes of
      processing your transactions, establishing and/or verifying a person’s or
      account holder’s identity, customer service, improving and customizing our
      Services and their content, authorization, content processing, content
      classification, and providing you with information concerning our
      Services.
      We
      will retain this information for as long as your account is active or as
      needed to provide you Services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve
      disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

    <p>For example, our EBSCOhost Service employs a personalization feature that
      requires completion of a registration form before a user can use that
      feature.
      The personalization feature of EBSCOhost is a powerful tool that provides
      users with the means to create and save histories of searches they have
      conducted. We believe the personalization feature is a useful tool that
      will
      enhance the user's experience with the Service, but it does require the
      user
      to provide Personal Information to us.</p>

    <p>We use the non-Personal Information we collect to administer the
      Services,
      improve access to the Services, perform diagnostics, collect content-specific usage statistics, protect
      the
      Services and their content from inappropriate use, and improve the user's
      experience.</p>

    <p>We may use the Personal Information and non-Personal Information we
      collect
      by sharing it with third-party agents, vendors, contractors, partners, or
      content providers of EBSCO Information Services (collectively, "Service
      Providers") for purposes of managing purchases of our products and
      services,
      providing access to our products and services, servicing our systems, and obtaining support services for our businesses.
      We
      are not in the business of selling Personal Information to third-parties
      or
      Service Providers and will share it with Service Providers only as we
      describe
      in this Privacy Policy. In situations where we share Personal Information
      with
      Service Providers, we ensure access is granted to the Service Providers
      only
      upon the condition that the Personal Information is kept confidential and
      is
      used only for carrying out the services these Service Providers are
      performing
      for EBSCO Information Services. As part of making the determination
      whether
      we
      will share Personal Information with Service providers, we will obtain
      assurances that they will appropriately protect and maintain the
      confidentiality of Personal Information consistent with this Privacy
      Policy
      and as required by applicable law.</p>

    <p>The Personal Information we collect from you may be transferred to, and
      processed in, countries other than the country in which you live. These
      countries may have data protection laws that are different than the laws
      of
      your country. Specifically, the servers we use to provide our Services are
      located in the United States. This means that when we collect your
      Personal
      Information, we may process it in the United States or the country where
      you
      live. However, when we process your Personal Information, irrelevant of
      its
      processing location, we take appropriate measures, as discussed below, to
      ensure that your Personal Information remains protected in accordance with
      this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>We may share your usage data related to our Services with our affiliates
      and
      certain Service Providers for purposes of providing or improving our
      Services.
      We will not disclose any information about your usage data related to our
      Services to unaffiliated third-parties, except as necessary to provide our
      Services, enhance the product experience, service the legal agreement
      between
      us and your employer or affiliated institution under which you are
      provided
      access to our Services, to enforce the terms of use, to meet our
      contractual
      obligations to report aggregated usage data to content providers, or as
      required by law.</p>
    <p>
      We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information if we are
      required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of
      the
      information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, and to
      the
      extent permitted by applicable local law, to respond to claims, or to
      protect
      or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our
      employees, customers, or the public.</p>

    <p>We will not use your Personal Information for automated-decision
      making.</p>
    <p>In the unlikely event that all or substantially all of the assets of
      EBSCO
      Information Services or any of its applicable subsidiaries are acquired,
      customer information, which may include Personal Information, may be one
      of
      the transferred assets unless restricted by applicable local law, in which
      case the acquiring entity will be subject to the same commitments for such
      customer information.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>D.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is Our Legal Basis for Collecting and Using
        Personal Information?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information
      described
      above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific
      context in which we collect it.</p>

    <p>However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you
        or
        your organization;</li>
      <li>where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden
        by
        your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms; or
      </li>
      <li>where we have your consent to do so.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal
      Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to
      protect
      your vital interests or those of another person.</p>

    <p>If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal
      requirement or to provide the Services or a feature of the Services
      pursuant
      to a contract with your institution, we will make this clear at the
      relevant
      time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is
      mandatory or not (as well as of the possible impact if you do not provide
      your
      Personal Information).</p>

    <p>Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on
      our
      legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to
      you
      at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>

    <p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the
      legal
      basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please
      contact
      us

    <a name="prod_how-do-we-secure-info"></a>
    <p>
      <strong>E.&nbsp;&nbsp; How Do We Secure Personal Information?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>EBSCO Information Services has taken appropriate technical and
      organizational
      measures to ensure that Personal Information we have collected or will
      collect
      in the future is secure. For example, we have limited the number of people
      who
      have access to Personal Information, by electronic security systems and
      authentication methods that guard against unauthorized access.</p>

    <p>As a reminder, EBSCO Information Services provides links to third-party
      websites. These websites may not have the same privacy policies as EBSCO
      Information Services. We take reasonable care in recommending these
      websites,
      but we are not responsible for their content or privacy policies. We urge
      users to read the privacy statement of a third-party website when leaving
      our
      Services and linking to a third-party website.</p>
    <p>We always use industry-standard technologies when transferring and
      receiving
      consumer data we receive. We have appropriate security measures in place
      in
      our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration
      of
      information that we have collected from you in connection with our
      Services.

      <u>Verification of Requests</u>
    </p>

    <p>All requests submitted to us will be verified to ensure that the person
      making the request (the “Requstor”) is the individual about whom we have
      collected Personal Information. The method we use to verify the
      Requestor’s
      identity may vary based on the type of customer or user, the Services
      used,
      and the type of Personal Information we have collected. In most cases, we
      will
      require the Requestor to provide the following information when submitting
      a
      request:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Type of Customer or User</li>
      <li>First Name</li>
      <li>Last Name</li>
      <li>Email Address</li>
      <li>Country</li>
      <li>State</li>
      <li>Legal Relationship to the Subject of the Request</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will use this identifying information to communicate with the
      Requestor
      and receive confirmation that they submitted the request, and then match
      this
      identifying information with the Personal Information we already
      maintain.&nbsp; We may also use the contact information that we already
      maintain to communicate with the individual to confirm that they submitted
      the
      request.&nbsp; In rare cases, we may ask for additional information to
      verify
      the request, which may include a signed declaration under penalty of
      perjury
      that the Requestor is the individual whose Personal Information is the
      subject
      of the request.</p>

    <p>If the Requestor submits a request to delete Personal Information, we
      will
      separately confirm that the individual wants their Personal Information
      deleted.</p>

    <p>We may deny a request if we cannot verify the identity of the Requestor
      to
      a
      reasonable degree of certainty or a reasonably high degree of certainty
      (depending on the type of request, the sensitivity of the Personal
      Information, and the risk of harm to the individual posed by a
      unauthorized
      request) or, in the case of a request to delete Personal Information, we
      may
      deny a request if we are not able to separately confirm that the
      individual
      wants their Personal Information deleted.</p>

    <p>
      <u>Authorized Agent</u>
    </p>

    <p>If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we will require that
      you:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>provide the authorized agent written permission to act as your
        authorized
        agent; and</li>
      <li>verify the authorized agent’s identity directly with us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The above authorized agent requirements do not apply if you have provided
      the
      authorized agent with legally binding power of attorney in accordance with
      applicable law.</p>

    <p>We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they
      have
      been authorized by you to act on their behalf.</p>

      <strong>H.&nbsp; What Choices Do I Have?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>We understand that you may not want to allow our disclosure of your
      Personal
      Information to our Service Providers, or to let us use that information
      for
      purposes that you believe may be incompatible with the purpose for which
      it
      originally was collected or that you later may authorize. Therefore, you
      may
      contact us to inform us that you do not want to permit these uses of your
      Personal Information. To do so, please contact us using the contact
      information provided
      <a href="#privacy_contact_info">above</a>.</p>

    <p>It is important to us that the Personal Information we collect is
      appropriate
      and relevant to the purposes for which we intend to use it. We will use
      Personal Information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes
      for
      which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the person providing
      the
      information. EBSCO Information Services will take reasonable steps to
      ensure
      that Personal Information is relevant to its intended use, accurate,
      complete,
      and current.</p>

    <p>You may sign-up to receive email newsletters or other marketing materials
      from us. If you would like to discontinue receiving this information, you
      may
      immediately update your email preferences free of cost by using the

      settings within the Services or by submitting a request using any of the

      <strong>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collection and Use of Information from
        Children:
        Information for Parents</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Most of our Services are not directed toward children. For our Services
      that
      are designed to be used by children under 16 years of age, we comply with
      the
      provisions of the Children's On-Line Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and
      other applicable laws. If a user under 16 years of age wants to use our
      personalization features, we ask the user to register with their first
      name
      (not considered personal information by the US Federal Trade Commission)
      and
      a
      unique identifier only.</p>

    <p>To the extent we collect any information of minors under 16 years of age
      that
      is considered personal information under any applicable law, we do not and
      will not sell such information without affirmative authorization and have
      not
      sold such information during the preceding 12 months or at any other time.

    <p>If you are a parent and have questions about our practices, please feel

      <strong>J.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How Long Do We Retain This
        Information?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an
      ongoing
      legitimate business interest or other legal need to do so (for example, to
      provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable
      legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>

    <p>When we have no further legitimate business interest or legal need to
      process
      your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if
      this
      is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been
      stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal
      Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
      possible.</p>

      <strong>2. Non-Personal Information:
      </strong>EBSCO Information Services collects information that does not
      directly reveal your identity or does not directly relate to an
      identifiable
      individual. This may include a unique identifier (unconnected to an
      individual’s Personal Information) and related analytics and usage
      information
      that we use to track usage of our Websites, track trends in our Websites,
      administer the Websites, and improve our users’ experience.</p>

    <a name="site_how-do-we-collect-info"></a>
    <p>
      <strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; How Do We Collect the Information?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>The categories of sources from which we collect Personal Information are
      described in the
      <a href="#website_pi_categories">table</a> above.</p>

    <p>We only collect and use Personal Information when you voluntarily provide
      it
      to us, with the exception of your IP address, geolocation, and certain
      device
      information which may be automatically captured when you access our
      Websites.
    </p>

    <p>Under limited circumstances, we also collect limited business contact
      information from legitimate third parties (for example, third parties that
      provide attendee lists or business prospect lists). This helps us to
      update
      or
      expand our records. If you provide us Personal Information about others,
      or
      if
      others give us your Personal Information, we will only use that
      information
      for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. Examples of the
      types
      of Personal Information that may be obtained from public sources or
      purchased
      from third parties and combined with information we already have about
      you,
      may include name, email address, job title, and company/institution
      affiliation.</p>

    <p>In order to use some portions of our Websites, a user must first complete
      a
      registration form or provide an e-mail address that will require the
      user’s
      disclosure of limited Personal Information. Such disclosure is strictly
      voluntary.</p>

    <p>Because of how email communication works, you will have to disclose an
      email
      address to us if you choose to contact us or communicate with us by email.
    </p>

    <p>We automatically collect non-Personal Information generated from your use
      of
      our Websites. We use this non-Personal Information in the aggregate. We do
      not
      combine these types of non-Personal Information with Personal Information.

      on

      You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post

      about your activities on our Websites to a profile page of yours that is
      provided by a third-party Social Media network in order to share with
      others
      within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third

      <strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; How Do We Use the Information?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>The business or commercial purpose(s) for which Personal Information is
      collected is described in the
      <a href="#website_pi_categories">table</a> above.</p>

    <p>We use the Personal Information we collect for limited internal purposes
      that
      may include, but are not limited to, processing your transactions,
      establishing and/or verifying a person’s or account holder’s identity,
      customer service, improving and customizing our Websites and their
      content,
      development of products and services, content processing, content
      classification, and providing you with information concerning our products
      and
      services. We will retain this information for as long as it is needed for
      the
      purposes for which it was collected, and/or to comply with our legal
      obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

    <p>We use the non-Personal Information we collect to administer the
      Websites,
      perform diagnostics, collect content-specific usage statistics, protect
      the
      Websites and their content from inappropriate use, and improve the user's
      experience.</p>

    <p>We may use the Personal Information and non-Personal Information we
      collect
      by sharing it with third party agents, vendors, contractors, partners, or
      content providers of EBSCO Information Services (collectively, "Service
      Providers") for purposes of managing purchases of our products and
      services,
      servicing our systems, and obtaining support services for our businesses.
      We
      are not in the business of selling Personal Information to third parties
      or
      Service Providers and will share it with Service Providers only as we
      describe
      in this Privacy Policy. In situations where we share Personal Information
      with
      Service Providers, we ensure access is granted to the Service Providers
      only
      upon the condition that the Personal Information is kept confidential and
      is
      used only for carrying out the services these Service Providers are
      performing
      for EBSCO Information Services. As part of making that determination
      whether
      we will share Personal Information with Service Providers, we will obtain
      assurances that they will appropriately protect and maintain the
      confidentiality of Personal Information consistent with this Privacy
      Policy
      and as required by applicable law.</p>

    <p>The Personal Information we collect from you may be transferred to, and
      processed in, countries other than the country in which you live. These
      countries may have data protection laws that are different than the laws
      of
      your country. Specifically, the servers we use to provide our Services are
      located in the United States. This means that when we collect your
      Personal
      Information, we may process it in the United States or the country where
      you
      live. However, when we process your Personal Information, irrelevant of
      its
      processing location, we take appropriate measures, as discussed below, to
      ensure that your Personal Information remains protected in accordance with
      this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>We may share your usage data related to our Websites with our affiliates
      and
      certain Service Providers for purposes of providing or improving our
      Websites.
      We will not disclose any information about your usage data related to our
      Websites to unaffiliated third-parties, except as necessary to enhance the
      website experience, to enforce the terms of use, or as required by law.
    </p>

    <p>We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information if we are
      required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of
      the
      information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, and to
      the
      extent permitted by local law, to respond to claims, or to protect or
      advance
      the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees,
      customers, or the public.</p>

    <p>We will not use your Personal Information for automated-decision making.
    </p>

    <p>In the unlikely event that all or substantially all of the assets of
      EBSCO
      Information Services or any of its applicable subsidiaries are acquired,
      customer information, which may include Personal Information, may be one
      of
      the transferred assets unless restricted by applicable local law, in which
      case the acquiring entity will be subject to the same commitments for such
      customer information.</p>

    <a name="site_what-is-legal-basis"></a>
    <p>
      <strong>D.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is Our Legal Basis for Collecting and Using
        Personal Information?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information
      described
      above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific
      context in which we collect it.</p>

    <p>However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you
        or
        your organization;</li>
      <li>where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden
        by
        your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms; or
      </li>
      <li>where we have your consent to do so.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal
      Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to
      protect
      your vital interests or those of another person.</p>

    <p>If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal
      requirement or to perform a contract, we will make this clear at the
      relevant
      time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is
      mandatory or not (as well as of the possible impact if you do not provide
      your
      Personal Information).</p>

    <p>Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on
      our
      legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to
      you
      at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>

    <p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the
      legal
      basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please
      contact
      us
      using the contact information provided
      <a href="#website_privacy_contact_info">below</a>.</p>

    <a name="site_how-do-we-secure-info"></a>
    <p>
      <strong>E.&nbsp;&nbsp; How Do We Secure Personal Information?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>EBSCO Information Services has taken appropriate technical and
      organizational
      measures to ensure that Personal Information we have collected or will
      collect
      in the future is secure. For example, we have limited the number of people
      who
      have access to Personal Information, by electronic security systems and
      authentication methods that guard against unauthorized access.</p>

    <p>As a reminder, EBSCO Information Services provides links to third-party
      websites. These websites may not have the same privacy policies as EBSCO

      <u>Verification of Requests</u>
    </p>

    <p>All requests submitted to us will be verified to ensure that the person
      making the request (the “Requstor”) is the individual about whom we have
      collected Personal Information. The method we use to verify the
      Requestor’s
      identity may vary based on the type of customer or user, the Websites
      used,
      and the type of Personal Information we have collected. In most cases, we
      will
      require the Requestor to provide the following information when submitting
      a
      request:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Type of Customer or User</li>
      <li>First Name</li>
      <li>Last Name</li>
      <li>Email Address</li>
      <li>Country</li>
      <li>State</li>
      <li>Legal Relationship to the Subject of the Request</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will use this identifying information to communicate with the
      Requestor
      and receive confirmation that they submitted the request, and then match
      this
      identifying information with the Personal Information we already
      maintain.&nbsp; We may also use the contact information that we already
      maintain to communicate with the individual to confirm that they submitted
      the
      request.&nbsp; In rare cases, we may ask for additional information to
      verify
      the request, which may include a signed declaration under penalty of
      perjury
      that the Requestor is the individual whose Personal Information is the
      subject
      of the request.</p>

    <p>If the Requestor submits a request to delete Personal Information, we
      will
      separately confirm that the individual wants their Personal Information
      deleted.</p>

    <p>We may deny a request if we cannot verify the identity of the Requestor
      to
      a
      reasonable degree of certainty or a reasonably high degree of certainty
      (depending on the type of request, the sensitivity of the Personal
      Information, and the risk of harm to the individual posed by a
      unauthorized
      request) or, in the case of a request to delete Personal Information, we
      may
      deny a request if we are not able to separately confirm that the
      individual
      wants their Personal Information deleted..</p>

    <p>
      <u>Authorized Agent</u>
    </p>

    <p>
      <a>If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we will require
        that
        you:</a>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>provide the authorized agent written permission to act as your
        authorized
        agent; and</li>
      <li>verify the authorized agent’s identity directly with us.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The above authorized agent requirements do not apply if you have provided
      the
      authorized agent with legally binding power of attorney in accordance with
      applicable law.</p>

    <p>We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they
      have
      been authorized by you to act on their behalf.</p>
