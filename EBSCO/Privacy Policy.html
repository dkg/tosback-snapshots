<p><a name="prod_non-personal-info" id="prod_non-personal-info"></a></p>

<p><strong>2. Non-Personal Information: </strong>EBSCO Information Services collects information that does not directly reveal your identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This may include a unique identifier (unconnected to an individual’s Personal Information) and related analytics and usage information that we use to track usage of our Services, track trends in our Services, administer the Services, and improve our users’ experience. </p>

<p><a name="prod_how-do-we-collect-info" id="prod_how-do-we-collect-info"></a></p>

<p><strong>B.   How Do We Collect the Information?</strong></p>

<p>The categories of sources from which we collect Personal Information are described in the <a href="#pi_categories">table</a> above.</p>

<p>We only collect and use Personal Information when you voluntarily provide it to us or when an institutional customer provides it to us in connection with its method of authenticating users for access to our Services, with the exception of your IP address, geolocation, and certain device information which may be automatically captured when you access our Services.</p>

<p>If you provide us Personal Information about others, or if others give us your Personal Information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>

<p>In order to use some of the unique functions within our Services, a user must first complete a registration form or provide an email address that will require the user’s disclosure of limited Personal Information. Such disclosure is strictly voluntary.</p>

<p>Because of how email communication works, you will have to disclose an email address to us if you choose to contact us or communicate with us by email.</p>

<p>We automatically collect non-Personal Information generated from your use of our Services. We use this non-Personal Information in the aggregate. We do not combine these types of non-Personal Information with Personal Information.</p>

<p><a name="prod_cookies" id="prod_cookies"></a></p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong>  For information about the cookies and other tracking technologies used by our Services and how to manage your settings for these cookies and technologies, please visit our <a href="https://www.ebsco.com/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

<p><a name="prod_how-do-we-use-the-info" id="prod_how-do-we-use-the-info"></a></p>

<p><strong>C.   How Do We Use the Information?</strong></p>

<p>The business or commercial purpose(s) for which Personal Information is collected is described in the <a href="#pi_categories">table</a> above.</p>

<p>We use the Personal Information we collect for the limited purposes of processing your transactions, establishing and/or verifying a person’s or account holder’s identity, customer service, improving and customizing our Services and their content, authorization, content processing, content classification, and providing you with information concerning our Services. We will retain this information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<p>For example, our EBSCOhost Service employs a personalization feature that requires completion of a registration form before a user can use that feature. The personalization feature of EBSCOhost is a powerful tool that provides users with the means to create and save histories of searches they have conducted. We believe the personalization feature is a useful tool that will enhance the user's experience with the Service, but it does require the user to provide Personal Information to us.</p>

<p>We use the non-Personal Information we collect to administer the Services, improve access to the Services, perform diagnostics, collect content-specific usage statistics, protect the Services and their content from inappropriate use, and improve the user's experience.</p>

<p>We may use the Personal Information and non-Personal Information we collect by sharing it with third-party agents, vendors, contractors, partners, or content providers of EBSCO Information Services (collectively, "Service Providers") for purposes of managing purchases of our products and services, providing access to our products and services, servicing our systems, and obtaining support services for our businesses. We are not in the business of selling Personal Information to third-parties or Service Providers and will share it with Service Providers only as we describe in this Privacy Policy. In situations where we share Personal Information with Service Providers, we ensure access is granted to the Service Providers only upon the condition that the Personal Information is kept confidential and is used only for carrying out the services these Service Providers are performing for EBSCO Information Services. As part of making the determination whether we will share Personal Information with Service providers, we will obtain assurances that they will appropriately protect and maintain the confidentiality of Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy and as required by applicable law.</p>

<p>The Personal Information we collect from you may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you live. These countries may have data protection laws that are different than the laws of your country. Specifically, the servers we use to provide our Services are located in the United States. This means that when we collect your Personal Information, we may process it in the United States or the country where you live. However, when we process your Personal Information, irrelevant of its processing location, we take appropriate measures, as discussed below, to ensure that your Personal Information remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We may share your usage data related to our Services with our affiliates and certain Service Providers for purposes of providing or improving our Services. We will not disclose any information about your usage data related to our Services to unaffiliated third-parties, except as necessary to provide our Services, enhance the product experience, service the legal agreement between us and your employer or affiliated institution under which you are provided access to our Services, to enforce the terms of use, to meet our contractual obligations to report aggregated usage data to content providers, or as required by law.</p>

<p>We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, and to the extent permitted by applicable local law, to respond to claims, or to protect or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees, customers, or the public.</p>

<p>We will not use your Personal Information for automated-decision making.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that all or substantially all of the assets of EBSCO Information Services or any of its applicable subsidiaries are acquired, customer information, which may include Personal Information, may be one of the transferred assets unless restricted by applicable local law, in which case the acquiring entity will be subject to the same commitments for such customer information.</p>

<p><a name="prod_what-is-legal-basis" id="prod_what-is-legal-basis"></a></p>

<p><strong>D.   What is Our Legal Basis for Collecting and Using Personal Information?</strong></p>

<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>

<p>However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only:</p>

<ul><li>where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you or your organization;</li>
	<li>where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms; or</li>
	<li>where we have your consent to do so.</li>
</ul><p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>

<p>If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to provide the Services or a feature of the Services pursuant to a contract with your institution, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible impact if you do not provide your Personal Information).</p>

<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>

<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact information provided <a href="#privacy_contact_info">below</a>.</p>

<p><a name="prod_how-do-we-secure-info" id="prod_how-do-we-secure-info"></a></p>

<p><strong>E.   How Do We Secure Personal Information?</strong></p>

<p>EBSCO Information Services has taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that Personal Information we have collected or will collect in the future is secure. For example, we have limited the number of people who have access to Personal Information, by electronic security systems and authentication methods that guard against unauthorized access.</p>

<p>As a reminder, EBSCO Information Services provides links to third-party websites. These websites may not have the same privacy policies as EBSCO Information Services. We take reasonable care in recommending these websites, but we are not responsible for their content or privacy policies. We urge users to read the privacy statement of a third-party website when leaving our Services and linking to a third-party website.</p>

<p>We always use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data we receive. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you in connection with our Services.</p>

In such cases, we will cease processing your Personal Information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for compliance and/or legal reasons.

</ol><p><em>Verification of Requests</em></p>

<p>All requests submitted to us will be verified to ensure that the person making the request (the “Requstor”) is the individual about whom we have collected Personal Information. The method we use to verify the Requestor’s identity may vary based on the type of customer or user, the Services used, and the type of Personal Information we have collected. In most cases, we will require the Requestor to provide the following information when submitting a request:</p>

<ul><li>Type of Customer or User</li>
	<li>First Name</li>
	<li>Last Name</li>
	<li>Email Address</li>
	<li>Country</li>
	<li>State</li>
	<li>Legal Relationship to the Subject of the Request</li>
</ul><p>We will use this identifying information to communicate with the Requestor and receive confirmation that they submitted the request, and then match this identifying information with the Personal Information we already maintain.  We may also use the contact information that we already maintain to communicate with the individual to confirm that they submitted the request.  In rare cases, we may ask for additional information to verify the request, which may include a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the Requestor is the individual whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.</p>

<p>If the Requestor submits a request to delete Personal Information, we will separately confirm that the individual wants their Personal Information deleted.</p>

<p>We may deny a request if we cannot verify the identity of the Requestor to a reasonable degree of certainty or a reasonably high degree of certainty (depending on the type of request, the sensitivity of the Personal Information, and the risk of harm to the individual posed by a unauthorized request) or, in the case of a request to delete Personal Information, we may deny a request if we are not able to separately confirm that the individual wants their Personal Information deleted.</p>

<p><em>Authorized Agent</em></p>

<p>If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we will require that you:</p>

<ul><li>provide the authorized agent written permission to act as your authorized agent; and</li>
	<li>verify the authorized agent’s identity directly with us.</li>
</ul><p>The above authorized agent requirements do not apply if you have provided the authorized agent with legally binding power of attorney in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<p>We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>We understand that you may not want to allow our disclosure of your Personal Information to our Service Providers, or to let us use that information for purposes that you believe may be incompatible with the purpose for which it originally was collected or that you later may authorize.

<p>Most of our Services are not directed toward children. For our Services that are designed to be used by children under 16 years of age, we comply with the provisions of the Children's On-Line Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and other applicable laws. If a user under 16 years of age wants to use our personalization features, we ask the user to register with their first name (not considered personal information by the US Federal Trade Commission) and a unique identifier only.</p>

<p>To the extent we collect any information of minors under 16 years of age that is considered personal information under any applicable law, we do not and will not sell such information without affirmative authorization and have not sold such information during the preceding 12 months or at any other time.</p>

<p><strong>J.    How Long Do We Retain This Information?</strong></p>

<p>We retain Personal Information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business interest or other legal need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).</p>

<p>When we have no further legitimate business interest or legal need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<p><strong>2. Non-Personal Information: </strong>EBSCO Information Services collects information that does not directly reveal your identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual. This may include a unique identifier (unconnected to an individual’s Personal Information) and related analytics and usage information that we use to track usage of our Websites, track trends in our Websites, administer the Websites, and improve our users’ experience.</p>

<p><a name="site_how-do-we-collect-info" id="site_how-do-we-collect-info"></a></p>

<p><strong>B.   How Do We Collect the Information?</strong></p>

<p>The categories of sources from which we collect Personal Information are described in the <a href="#website_pi_categories">table</a> above.</p>

<p>We only collect and use Personal Information when you voluntarily provide it to us, with the exception of your IP address, geolocation, and certain device information which may be automatically captured when you access our Websites.</p>

<p>Under limited circumstances, we also collect limited business contact information from legitimate third parties (for example, third parties that provide attendee lists or business prospect lists). This helps us to update or expand our records. If you provide us Personal Information about others, or if others give us your Personal Information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us. Examples of the types of Personal Information that may be obtained from public sources or purchased from third parties and combined with information we already have about you, may include name, email address, job title, and company/institution affiliation.</p>

<p>In order to use some portions of our Websites, a user must first complete a registration form or provide an e-mail address that will require the user’s disclosure of limited Personal Information. Such disclosure is strictly voluntary.</p>

<p>Because of how email communication works, you will have to disclose an email address to us if you choose to contact us or communicate with us by email.</p>

<p>We automatically collect non-Personal Information generated from your use of our Websites. We use this non-Personal Information in the aggregate. We do not combine these types of non-Personal Information with Personal Information.</p>

<p><a name="site_cookies" id="site_cookies"></a></p>

<p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong>  For information about the cookies and other tracking technologies used by our Websites and how to manage your settings for these cookies and technologies, please visit our <a href="https://www.ebsco.com/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Social Media Features:</strong>  Our Websites may use social media features, such as the Facebook ‘like’ button (“Social Media Features”). These features may collect your IP address and which page you are visiting on our Websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. You may be given the option by such Social Media Features to post information about your activities on our Websites to a profile page of yours that is provided by a third-party Social Media network in order to share with others within your network. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the relevant Social Media Features.</p>

<p><a name="site_how-do-we-use-the-info" id="site_how-do-we-use-the-info"></a></p>

<p><strong>C.   How Do We Use the Information?</strong></p>

<p>The business or commercial purpose(s) for which Personal Information is collected is described in the <a href="#website_pi_categories">table</a> above.</p>

<p>We use the Personal Information we collect for limited internal purposes that may include, but are not limited to, processing your transactions, establishing and/or verifying a person’s or account holder’s identity, customer service, improving and customizing our Websites and their content, development of products and services, content processing, content classification, and providing you with information concerning our products and services. We will retain this information for as long as it is needed for the purposes for which it was collected, and/or to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<p>We use the non-Personal Information we collect to administer the Websites, perform diagnostics, collect content-specific usage statistics, protect the Websites and their content from inappropriate use, and improve the user's experience.</p>

<p>We may use the Personal Information and non-Personal Information we collect by sharing it with third party agents, vendors, contractors, partners, or content providers of EBSCO Information Services (collectively, "Service Providers") for purposes of managing purchases of our products and services, servicing our systems, and obtaining support services for our businesses. We are not in the business of selling Personal Information to third parties or Service Providers and will share it with Service Providers only as we describe in this Privacy Policy. In situations where we share Personal Information with Service Providers, we ensure access is granted to the Service Providers only upon the condition that the Personal Information is kept confidential and is used only for carrying out the services these Service Providers are performing for EBSCO Information Services. As part of making that determination whether we will share Personal Information with Service Providers, we will obtain assurances that they will appropriately protect and maintain the confidentiality of Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy and as required by applicable law.</p>

<p>The Personal Information we collect from you may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you live. These countries may have data protection laws that are different than the laws of your country. Specifically, the servers we use to provide our Services are located in the United States. This means that when we collect your Personal Information, we may process it in the United States or the country where you live. However, when we process your Personal Information, irrelevant of its processing location, we take appropriate measures, as discussed below, to ensure that your Personal Information remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>We may share your usage data related to our Websites with our affiliates and certain Service Providers for purposes of providing or improving our Websites. We will not disclose any information about your usage data related to our Websites to unaffiliated third-parties, except as necessary to enhance the website experience, to enforce the terms of use, or as required by law.</p>

<p>We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, and to the extent permitted by local law, to respond to claims, or to protect or advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees, customers, or the public.</p>

<p>We will not use your Personal Information for automated-decision making.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that all or substantially all of the assets of EBSCO Information Services or any of its applicable subsidiaries are acquired, customer information, which may include Personal Information, may be one of the transferred assets unless restricted by applicable local law, in which case the acquiring entity will be subject to the same commitments for such customer information.</p>

<p><a name="site_what-is-legal-basis" id="site_what-is-legal-basis"></a></p>

<p><strong>D.   What is Our Legal Basis for Collecting and Using Personal Information?</strong></p>

<p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the Personal Information described above will depend on the Personal Information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>

<p>However, we will normally collect Personal Information from you only:</p>

<ul><li>where we need the Personal Information to perform a contract with you or your organization;</li>
	<li>where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms; or</li>
	<li>where we have your consent to do so.</li>
</ul><p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect Personal Information from you or may otherwise need the Personal Information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>

<p>If we ask you to provide Personal Information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your Personal Information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible impact if you do not provide your Personal Information).</p>

<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your Personal Information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.</p>

<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your Personal Information, please contact us using the contact information provided <a href="#website_privacy_contact_info">below</a>.</p>

<p><a name="site_how-do-we-secure-info" id="site_how-do-we-secure-info"></a></p>

<p><strong>E.   How Do We Secure Personal Information?</strong></p>

<p>EBSCO Information Services has taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that Personal Information we have collected or will collect in the future is secure. For example, we have limited the number of people who have access to Personal Information, by electronic security systems and authentication methods that guard against unauthorized access.</p>

<p>As a reminder, EBSCO Information Services provides links to third-party websites. These websites may not have the same privacy policies as EBSCO Information Services. We take reasonable care in recommending these websites, but we are not responsible for their content or privacy policies. We urge users to read the privacy statement of a third-party website when leaving our Websites and linking to a third-party website.<br /><br />
We always use industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data we receive. We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you in connection with our Websites.</p>

</ol><p><em>Verification of Requests</em></p>

<p>All requests submitted to us will be verified to ensure that the person making the request (the “Requstor”) is the individual about whom we have collected Personal Information. The method we use to verify the Requestor’s identity may vary based on the type of customer or user, the Websites used, and the type of Personal Information we have collected. In most cases, we will require the Requestor to provide the following information when submitting a request:</p>

<ul><li>Type of Customer or User</li>
	<li>First Name</li>
	<li>Last Name</li>
	<li>Email Address</li>
	<li>Country</li>
	<li>State</li>
	<li>Legal Relationship to the Subject of the Request</li>
</ul><p>We will use this identifying information to communicate with the Requestor and receive confirmation that they submitted the request, and then match this identifying information with the Personal Information we already maintain.  We may also use the contact information that we already maintain to communicate with the individual to confirm that they submitted the request.  In rare cases, we may ask for additional information to verify the request, which may include a signed declaration under penalty of perjury that the Requestor is the individual whose Personal Information is the subject of the request.</p>

<p>If the Requestor submits a request to delete Personal Information, we will separately confirm that the individual wants their Personal Information deleted.</p>

<p>We may deny a request if we cannot verify the identity of the Requestor to a reasonable degree of certainty or a reasonably high degree of certainty (depending on the type of request, the sensitivity of the Personal Information, and the risk of harm to the individual posed by a unauthorized request) or, in the case of a request to delete Personal Information, we may deny a request if we are not able to separately confirm that the individual wants their Personal Information deleted..</p>

<p><em>Authorized Agent</em></p>

<p><a>If you use an authorized agent to submit a request, we will require that you:</a></p>

<ul><li>provide the authorized agent written permission to act as your authorized agent; and</li>
	<li>verify the authorized agent’s identity directly with us.</li>
</ul><p>The above authorized agent requirements do not apply if you have provided the authorized agent with legally binding power of attorney in accordance with applicable law.</p>

<p>We may deny a request from an agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act on their behalf.</p>

<p>When we have no further legitimate business interest or legal need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
