Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part
of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for
MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</p><p><strong>Applicability
of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product
or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small
claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under
the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration
proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you
and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors
in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized
users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.</p><p><strong>Arbitration
Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall
be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative
dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.
If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative
ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration
except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer
Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by
calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single,
neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought
is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding
non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For
claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S.
Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the
Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your
residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties
agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the
parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any
judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than
the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of
arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each
party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration
and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</p><p><strong>Additional
Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong> If non-appearance based arbitration is elected,
the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written
submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.
The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses
unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p><p><strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues arbitration,
the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations
and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</p><p><strong>Authority
of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration
is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the
Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined
with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant
motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority
to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available
to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator
shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings
and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator has the same authority
to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.
The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.</p><p><strong>Waiver of
Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES
HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A
TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes
shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures
are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable
in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation
should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit
to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE
ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p><p><strong>Waiver of
Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must
be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and
claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly
or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.</p><p><strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding
shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless
otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting
to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce
an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</p><p><strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration
Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and
shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect.</p><p><strong>Right to
Waive.</strong> Any or all of
the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived
by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or
affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p><strong>Survival
of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration
Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.</p><p><strong>Small Claims
Court.</strong> Nonetheless the
foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims
court.</p><p><strong>Emergency
Equitable Relief.</strong> Anyhow
the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or
federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request
for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations
under this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p><strong>Claims Not
Subject to Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer
Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party&rsquo;s patent,
copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</p><p>In any circumstances
where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court,
the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located
within Netherlands County, California, for such purposes.</p><p>The Site may
be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations
in other countries. You agree not to export, re-export, or transfer, directly or
indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing
such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.</p><p>Company is located

complaints to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product
of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at
400 R Street, Sacramento, CA 95814, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.</p><p><strong>Electronic
Communications.</strong> The
communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the
Site or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Site or communicates
with you via email. For contractual purposes, you (a) consent to receive communications
from Company in an electronic form; and (b) agree that all terms and conditions,
agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Company provides
to you electronically satisfy any legal obligation that such communications would
satisfy if it were be in a hard copy writing.</p><p><strong>Entire Terms.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement
between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce
any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right
or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have
no legal or contractual effect. The word &ldquo;including&rdquo; means &ldquo;including
without limitation&rdquo;. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid
or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the
invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and
enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company
is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of
the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned,
subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company&rsquo;s prior
written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer
in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Company may freely assign these
Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.</p><p><strong>Your Privacy.</strong> Please read <a href="https://pure.dating/privacy/">our Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p><strong>Copyright/Trademark
