			<p>These Terms of Service apply to the executable code version of Cocoon</p>
<p>Cocoon is aimed at providing the best rewards program (&#8220;Service&#8221;). As such, it&#8217;s worth noting a few major items:</p>
<p>By creating a Cocoon account or Logging In, you acknowledge and agree to Cocoon collecting information on the apps installed on any device the software is installed on. This information may be used to ensure that Cocoon is able to promote relevant apps and offers.</p>
<p>Members are not permitted to attempt &#8220;gaming&#8221; or &#8220;hacking&#8221; the Cocoon program in any way.</p>
<p>Members will not, under any circumstances, encourage other members or any other persons to hack or game the Cocoon program including via online blogs, forums, groups, etc.</p>
<p>Members will not post referral links in an attempt to trick members or any other persons through deceptive means, inaccurate descriptions, fake earning opportunities or other questionable methods as determined by the Cocoon staff.</p>
<p>Cocoon at its sole discretion will and can cancel or remove your account or suspend your account entirely if Cocoon has reasons to believe that rewards were earned through means that are against the Cocoon Terms &amp; Conditions as well as the spirit of the guidelines. Examples of abuse that Cocoon&#8217;s automated technology will flag and will not be tolerated include: extended inactivity, software that attempts to manipulate the program in any way, and app usage anomalies outside of normal behavior patterns.</p>
<p>Violating any of these terms or any of the terms below will mean immediate revocation of earned rewards and potentially means being blacklisted from Cocoon in perpetuity.</p>
<p>THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (&#8220;AGREEMENT&#8221;) GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE.</p>
<p>Cocoon is pleased to provide and maintain our product (the &#8221; Software&#8221;). Except as otherwise indicated by Cocoon, the Software includes the Cocoon mobile apps, tablet apps and any other versions of our product and any updates, new versions or new releases of the product. Cocoon’s software also includes the desktop web browser for Windows and Macintosh.</p>
<p>Cocoon&#8217;s browser is built on the Chromium Open Source project. More about Chromium and the copyrights and conditions can be learned about here: <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/LICENSE">http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/LICENSE</a></p>

			<h2><strong>Your relationship with Cocoon</strong></h2>
<p>Your use of Cocoon’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Cocoon under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Cocoon. “Cocoon” refers to Virtual World Computing, whose principal place of business is at 5425 Hollister Ave, Ste 160, Santa Barbara, CA 93111, United States. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Cocoon, your agreement with Cocoon will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”. Open source software licenses for Cocoon browser source code constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that the open source software licenses expressly supersede these Universal Terms, the open source licenses govern your agreement with Cocoon for the use of Cocoon browser or specific included components of Cocoon.</p>
<p>Your agreement with Cocoon will also include the terms set forth below in the Cocoon browser Additional Terms of Service and terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.</p>
<p>The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Cocoon in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.</p>
<p>If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.</p>

<p><strong>Notification with respect to Children&#8217;s Privacy (Users under the age of 13)</strong></p>
<p>In response to concerns about protecting children&#8217;s privacy online, Congress enacted the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (&#8220;COPPA&#8221;), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with the Company policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT:</p>
<p>Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or</p>
<p>Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties;</p>
<p>We request that children under the age of 13 not submit any Personal Information to us via Cocoon services. It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers. All points or tokens earned by a member who is later identified as being in violation of these terms will be removed from the account. Questions regarding children&#8217;s privacy should be directed to: <a href="https://trycocoon.com/contact/">https://trycocoon.com/contact/</a></p>
