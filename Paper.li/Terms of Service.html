        <p>The different services proposed and powered by Finity include all services accessible via the Paper.li URL (<a href="https://paper.li/">paper.li</a>), the Finity URL (<a href="https://finity.ai/">finity.ai</a>) and our different Apps including, but not limited to, the <a href="https://www.wix.com/app-market/newspaper">News Page App for WIX</a>. All together defined as Services.</p>
        <p>Our Services offer you the possibility to monitor, aggregate and organize links, information, or any other publicly available material (Content) shared on third-party websites into an easy-to-discover, read and share format.</p>

        <p>Our Services display extracts of Content from third-party sites determined by the following: a) the criteria you choose in your content sources, and/or b) any content search features made available by the Services. Our Services then display the links and Content abstracts and determine their placement and location in our Services.</p>

We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage and/or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without prior notice or liability to you.</p>
        <p>We will use reasonable efforts to ensure that the Services are available twenty-four hours a day. However, there will be occasions when the Services may be interrupted for maintenance, upgrades and/or emergency repairs.

        <h2><a href="#trial" name="trial">Free trial</a></h2>
        <p>Newly created papers go through a 10-day free trial. The trial is cardless, meaning that you do not have to enter credit card, Paypal, or any other payment details in advance of the trial. Subscription to a paid Paper.li plan only happens if you take explicit actions. If you do not subscribe during the 10-day period, your paper will turn to the Free plan. Once this occurs, you can still upgrade your paper to Starter or Pro, but will not have the option to again have an additional free trial.</p>
