<p>Registration</p>
<p>In order to use our Services, we may ask you to provide certain personal Information when you create an account on www.arlo.com, or when you install and register on Arlo-owned Web Apps and Mobile Apps, register a Product, or sign up to be on our mailing list. We may ask you to submit the following types of personal Information: first and last name, country, email address, product serial number, date of purchase, telephone number, mailing address, and proof of purchase. The legal basis for this processing is Article 6 (1) b GDPR (performance of the contract).</p>
<p>Every time you use our website or app, we collect the access data that your browser or device automatically transmits to allow you to visit the website or app. This data is standard technical data (so-called log files) that are transmitted to our server:</p>
<ul>
<li>IP address of the requesting device,</li>
<li>Date and time of request,</li>
<li>Address of the website and the requesting website,</li>
<li>Information about the browser used, the operating system and the Internet Service Provider (ISP),</li>
<li>Online identifier (e.g. device identifiers, session IDs),</li>
<li>Volume.</li>
<li>The data processing of this access data is necessary to enable the visit of the website and the use of our app, and lastly facilitates the functionality and safety of our systems. For the purposes described above, access data is also temporarily stored in internal log files to provide statistical information about the use of our website and app in order to provide our website with the usage habits of our visitors. (For example, the number of mobile devices used to retrieve the pages) and to maintain our website and app administratively in general.</li>
</ul>
<p>The information stored in the log files does not allow any direct conclusions to be drawn about you – In particular, we only store the IP addresses in a shortened, anonymised form. The legal basis for this processing is Article 6 (1) f GDPR (legitimate business interest).</p>
<p><b>Download and installation of the application</b></p>
<p>In order to download and install our app from an app store (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store), you must first register with the provider of the app store for a user account and enter into a corresponding usage agreement with the store. We have no influence on this third party and are not party to the contract between you and the store. When downloading and installing the app, the necessary information is transferred to the respective app store, in particular your username, email address and your account's customer number, the time of download and the individual device identification number. We have no control over this data collection and are not responsible for it.

In this case, the legal basis for this is Article 6 (1) f GDPR (legitimate business interest).</p>
<p><b>Push News</b></p>
<p>The app can provide you with information through so-called push messages, even if you are not using the app in the foreground (e.g. status messages about the alarm system). The notes can be made using sound, messages (e.g. in the form of screen banners) and/or symbol marks (an image or digit on the app icon). To prevent this, you can disable the sending of push messages about your device setting at any time.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the aforementioned data processing is Article 6 (1) b (performance of the contract) GDPR, as far as push messages related to the contract processing. Otherwise, the legal basis is Article 6 (1) f GDPR, based on our legitimate interest in providing you with product recommendations.</p>

We do this based on Art. 6 1 (f) (legitimate business interest) and in some cases, Art. 6 1 (a) (your consent).</p>
<p>How you can manage your marketing preferences</p>
<p>To protect privacy rights and to ensure you have control over how we manage marketing with you:</p>

</ol>
<p>Security of your personal information</p>
<p>We have implemented and continuously improve our technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorised disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned.</p>
<p>As the security of your personal information depends in part on the effectiveness of the security of the devices (computer/ laptop/ mobile/ tablet/ etc) you use to communicate with us and the security measures you use to protect your access (User IDs and passwords), we encourage you to take necessary measures to protect this information.</p>
<p>Arlo wire-free cameras connect to the Arlo base station camera network using WiFI Protected Setup (WPS) and WPA2-AES data encryption. The WiFI connection is protected by a random, unique, long password that is not physically visible on the product. This password is programmed at the factory in the base station and re-generated upon factory-reset.</p>
<p>The Arlo base station connects to the backend through the customers home router using an Ethernet cable. Protective measures ensure that the base station is not accessible on the LAN.</p>
<p>The data is collected in a secure fashion, and Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used during the transportation of data. Accounts are authenticated using a secure login mechanism. We use one-way hashing in combination with salt for all passwords. Finally, we do not access or share any data unless required to by law or with your permission to help resolve system problems.</p>
<p>Payments: All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via secure communication methods and then securely stored into our payment gateway provider’s database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems. The payment gateway provider must keep the information confidential. Arlo Europe does not store payment information, instead such information is kept with our payment providers who are PCI compliant.</p>
<p>Personal information in the Arlo Communities and online</p>
<p>The Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our or our partners sites will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. This includes not sharing your passwords and not signing onto devices that you do not know. If you participate in a discussion forum, local communities, or chat room on an Arlo website, you should be aware that the information you provide there (i.e. your public profile) will be made broadly available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither we nor you have control over. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. We are not responsible for the Personal Information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
<p>Storing your personal information</p>
<p>Your personal information is stored for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as described in this privacy notice. Where your information is no longer needed, we will take steps to ensure that it is disposed of in a secure manner or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you. We have established time limits for certain data deletion, taking into account the type of services provided in the context of the Products and Services, the length of our relationship with you, mandatory retention periods, and the statute of limitations.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements. For example, we are obliged in certain cases store your personal information for tax and accounting purposes for periods of up to ten years from the end of the year in which business relations with you ends.</p>

Facebook can also create new audiences based on customer data and search for other users that resemble our customer groups.</p>

<li>To lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority</li>
<li>If you wish to access any of the above-mentioned rights, we may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, in particular before disclosing personal information to you. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can exercise your rights by  <a href="https://www.arlo.com/uk/about/privacy-policy/#contact">contacting us</a>. Subject to legal and other permissible considerations, we will make every reasonable effort to honour your request promptly or inform you if we require further information in order to fulfil your request.</p>
<p>We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.</p>
<p>Right to access personal information</p>
<p>You have a right to request that we provide you with a copy of your personal information that we hold and you have the right to be informed of; (a) the source of your personal information; (b) the purposes, legal basis and methods of processing; (c) the data controller’s identity; and (d) the entities or categories of entities to whom your personal information may be transferred.</p>
<p>Right to rectify or erase personal information</p>
<p>You have a right to request that we rectify inaccurate personal information. We may seek to verify the accuracy of the personal information before rectifying it.</p>
<p>You can also request that we erase your personal information in limited circumstances where: </p>
<p>it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; or</p>
<p>you have withdrawn your consent (where the data processing was based on consent); or</p>
<p>following a successful right to object (see right to object); or</p>
<p>it has been processed unlawfully; or</p>
<p>to comply with a legal obligation to which the Company is subject.</p>
<p>We are not required to comply with your request to erase personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary: </p>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>for compliance with a legal obligation; or</li>
<li>for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can ask us to restrict your personal information, but only where: </p>
<ol>
<li><ol>
<li>its accuracy is contested, to allow us to verify its accuracy; or</li>
<li>the processing is unlawful, but you do not want it erased; or</li>
<li>it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected, but we still need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
<li>you have exercised the right to object, and verification of overriding grounds is pending.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We can continue to use your personal information following a request for restriction, where: </p>
<ol>
<li> </li>
<li>we have your consent; or</li>
<li>to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
<li>to protect the rights of another natural or legal person.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Right to transfer your personal information</b></p>
<p>You can ask us to provide your personal information to you in a structured, commonly used, machine readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another data controller, but in each case only where;</p>
<ol>
<li>the processing is based on your consent or on the performance of a contract with you; and</li>
<li>the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Right to object to the processing of your personal information</b></p>
<p>You can object to any processing of your personal information which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests.</p>
<p>If you raise an objection, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><b>Right to object to how we use your personal information for direct marketing purposes</b></p>
<p>You can request that we change the manner in which we contact you for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>You can request that we not transfer your personal information to unaffiliated third parties for the purposes of direct marketing or any other purposes.</p>
<p><b>Right to obtain a copy of personal information safeguards used for transfers outside your jurisdiction</b></p>
<p>You can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your personal information is transferred outside of the European Union.</p>
<p>We may redact data transfer agreements to protect commercial terms.</p>
<p><b>Right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority</b></p>
<p>You have a right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority, which in Ireland is the Data Protection Commission, if you have concerns about how we are processing your personal information.</p>
<p>We ask that you please attempt to resolve any issues with us first, although you have a right to contact your supervisory authority at any time.</p>
