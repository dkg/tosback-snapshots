						<h5>SECTION 3. EXPLAINING MORE ABOUT DIRECT MARKETING AND PROFILING</h5>
					     <p><p>In this section you can find out more about</p>
<ol>
<li>how we use personal information to keep you up to date with our products and services.</li>
<li>how you can manage your marketing preferences</li>
<li>when and how we undertake profiling and analytics</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How we use personal information to keep you up to date with our products and services</strong></p>
<p>We may use personal information to let you know about our products and services that we believe will be of interest to you. We use the personal information that we may have such as first name, surname, home address, purchase history, telephone number, email address and country of residence. We may contact you by email, post, or telephone or through other communication channels (such as targeted online advertising). We only want to contact you when it makes sense, not for all types of advertising communications.</p>
<p>Where we have your contact details because you have recently bought or expressed an interest in our Products and Services, we will keep you informed about similar products or services (including special offers and discounts). In some cases, we receive personal information from third-party companies such as marketing companies, 3rd party advertising engines (such as Amazon LLC or Google LLC), web search engines and online comparison portals, such as your name, telephone number, e-mail address and IP address. We collect and process this data for the purpose of offering and selling our products and services to you.</p>
<p>We also use your personal information for statistical purposes to collate collected information that we use to improve our products and services and to administer the customer relationship. In all cases, we will respect your preferences for how you would like us to manage marketing activity with you. We do this based on Art. 6 1 (f) (legitimate business interest) and in some cases, Art. 6 1 (a) (your consent).</p>
<p><strong>How you can manage your marketing preferences</strong></p>
<p>To protect privacy rights and to ensure you have control over how we manage marketing with you:</p>
<ol>
<li>we will take steps to limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level and only send you communications which we believe may be of interest or relevance to you;</li>
<li>at any time, you can update or correct your personal profile, or change your preferences for the way in which you would like us to communicate with you, including how you receive details of latest offers or news updates from us;</li>
<li>if you have an online account with us, the easiest way to make updates to your marketing preferences and/or change your personal details is to log onto your account. You can also click the "unsubscribe" link that you find on any online newsletters you receive or contact our customer support team by <a href="/uk/support/contact.aspx" target="_blank">clicking here</a>;</li>
<li>you can ask us to stop direct marketing at any time you can ask us to stop sending email marketing, by following the "unsubscribe" link you will find on all the email marketing messages we send you. Alternatively, you can contact us <a href="#contact">here</a>. Please specify whether you would like us to stop all forms of marketing or just a particular type (e.g. email); and</li>
<li>you can change the way your browser manages cookies, which may be used to deliver online advertising, by following the settings on your browser.</li>
</ol>
<p>We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you on any social media platforms as well as your preferences within your account with us. To understand more about third parties who help with analytics, please see the cookie section below.</p>
<span id="verisure" />
<p><strong>When and how we undertake profiling and analytics</strong></p>
<p>We use your data as part of data analysis and market research. In particular, we pursue the purpose of dividing our customers and interested parties into different target and user groups in the context of market research (user segmentation), for insights into different target groups and their respective usage habits and interests, demographics and the marketing of these findings in the context of advertising services provided to third parties. We also use personal information to administer customer relations, for example to handle customer service matters, price adjustments and customer satisfaction surveys. In order to operate with suitable price adjustments for our different customer categories we may look at parameters such as your address, contract duration and your interactions with us. None of the aforementioned processing results in significant or legal decisions being made about you on a wholly automated basis.</p>
<p>Depending on the purpose, we use the data stored with us. For example, we use aggregated, statistical data, and also depersonalized (anonymized) data or pseudonymised data, as well as purchase history data and device and access data, for analytics, and for analysis. This gives us anonymous or pseudonymised insights into the general usage behaviour of our customers and interested parties. For more information please see the Cookie section below.</p></p>

						<h5>SECTION 4. TRANSFERRING PERSONAL INFORMATION GLOBALLY</h5>
					     <p><p>In this section you can find out more about:</p>
<ol>
<li>how we operate as a global business and transfer data internationally.</li>
<li>the arrangements we have in place to protect your personal information if we transfer it overseas.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How we operate as a global business and transfer data internationally</strong></p>
<p>We operate on a global basis. Accordingly, your personal information may be transferred and stored in countries outside the EU including the US, India, Switzerland, the UK, Norway, Peru, Argentina, Brazil and Chile that are subject to different standards of data protection.</p>
<p><strong>The arrangements we have in place to protect your personal information if we transfer it overseas</strong></p>
<p>We will take appropriate steps ensure that transfers of personal information are in accordance with applicable law and carefully managed to protect your privacy rights and interests and transfers are limited to countries which are recognized as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangement are in place to protect your privacy rights. To this end:</p>
<ol>
<li>we ensure transfers within the Verisure Group will be covered by an agreement entered into by members of the group (an intra group agreement) which contractually obliges each member to ensure that personal information receives an adequate and consistent level of protection wherever it is transferred within the Verisure Group;</li>
<li style="list-style: none"><span id="protection" />
<br /></li>
<li>where we transfer your personal information outside the Verisure group or to third parties who help provide our products and services, we obtain contractual commitments from them to protect your personal information. Some of these assurances are well recognized certification schemes like the EU US Privacy Shield for the protection of personal information transferred from within the EU to the United States; or</li>
<li>where we receive requests for information from law enforcement or regulators, we carefully validate these requests before any personal information are disclosed.</li>
<li style="list-style: none"><br /></li>
</ol>
<p>You have a right to <a href="#contact">contact us</a> for more information about the safeguards we have put in place (including a copy of relevant contractual commitments) to ensure the adequate protection of your personal information when this is transferred as mentioned above. The legal basis is both the contract concluded between you and us under Article 6 (1) b GDPR (performance of the contract), as well as Article 6 (1) f GDPR (legitimate business interest)</p></p>

						<h5>SECTION 5. HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE YOUR INFORMATION</h5>
					     <p><p>In this section you can find out more about</p>
<ol>
<li>Security of your personal information</li>
<li>Personal information in the Arlo Communities and online</li>
<li>Storing your personal information</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Security of your personal information</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented and continuously improve our technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorised disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned.</p>
<p>As the security of your personal information depends in part on the effectiveness of the security of the devices (computer/ laptop/ mobile/ tablet/ etc) you use to communicate with us and the security measures you use to protect your access (User IDs and passwords), we encourage you to take necessary measures to protect this information.</p>
<p>Arlo wire-free cameras connect to the Arlo base station camera network using WiFI Protected Setup (WPS) and WPA2-AES data encryption. The WiFI connection is protected by a random, unique, long password that is not physically visible on the product. This password is programmed at the factory in the base station and re-generated upon factory-reset.</p>
<p>The Arlo base station connects to the backend through the customers home router using an Ethernet cable. Protective measures ensure that the base station is not accessible on the LAN.</p>
<p>The data is collected in a secure fashion, and Transport Layer Security (TLS) is used during the transportation of data. Accounts are authenticated using a secure login mechanism. We use one-way hashing in combination with salt for all passwords. Finally, we do not access or share any data unless required to by law or with your permission to help resolve system problems.</p>
<p>Payments: All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via secure communication methods and then securely stored into our payment gateway provider’s database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems. The payment gateway provider must keep the information confidential. Arlo Europe does not store payment information, instead such information is kept with our payment providers who are PCI compliant.</p>
<p><strong>Personal information in the Arlo Communities and online</strong></p>
<span id="cookies" />
<p>The Internet is not 100% secure. We cannot promise that your use of our or our partners sites will be completely safe. We encourage you to use caution when using the Internet. This includes not sharing your passwords and not signing onto devices that you do not know. If you participate in a discussion forum, local communities, or chat room on an Arlo website, you should be aware that the information you provide there (i.e. your public profile) will be made broadly available to others, and could be used to contact you, send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes neither we nor you have control over. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. We are not responsible for the Personal Information or any other information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>
<p><strong>Storing your personal information</strong></p>
<p>Your personal information is stored for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as described in this privacy notice. Where your information is no longer needed, we will take steps to ensure that it is disposed of in a secure manner or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you. We have established time limits for certain data deletion, taking into account the type of services provided in the context of the Products and Services, the length of our relationship with you, mandatory retention periods, and the statute of limitations.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements. For example, we are obliged in certain cases store your personal information for tax and accounting purposes for periods of up to ten years from the end of the year in which business relations with you ends.</p></p>

					     <p><p><strong>Use of cookies and similar technologies for analysis purposes</strong></p>
<p>We also use cookies and similar technologies for advertising purposes. Some of the access data accessed when using our website is used for interest-based advertising. By analysing and evaluating this access data, we are able to show you personalized advertising on our website and on the websites of other providers.

<p>Data collected may be, in particular,</p>
<ol>
<li>The IP address of the device,</li>
<li>The date and time of access,</li>
<li>The identification number of a cookie,</li>
<li>Device recognition of mobile devices</li>
<li>And technical information about the browser and operating system.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the collected data is stored only pseudonymously, so that no direct conclusions can be drawn about you.

Such calls run separately from other Google services, which require users to authenticate, according to Google.</p>
