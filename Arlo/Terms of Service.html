<h2>Arlo Terms of Service</h2>
<section>
<div class="text-image-wrapper cf">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last Updated: August 26, 2020 - These updated terms do not apply to Arlo customers using Arlo in Europe.
</br>
The arbitration provisions in these revised terms of service do NOT apply retroactively or to latent claims that have accrued prior to the introduction of these revised Terms of Service (August 26, 2020) but not raised or filed yet.
</br>
We encourage you to read the complete Arlo Terms of Service below.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">PLEASE NOTE THAT SECTION 6 CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US. EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 6, THIS PROVISION REQUIRES THAT DISPUTES BE RESOLVED SOLELY THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND NOT AS A CLASS ARBITRATION OR CLASS ACTION.
</br>
IF YOU SIGN UP FOR ANY ARLO SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, YOU FURTHER AGREE, AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 10, THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION MAY AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR THE SAME APPLICABLE TERM AND PRICE, UNTIL YOU CANCEL.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Age:</span>You must be at least 18 years of age to sign up for Arlo, and by signing up for Arlo you confirm that you are at least 18 years old.

<h5>Introduction</h5>
<p><span id="service"> </span></p>
<p><span id="service">Welcome to Arlo. Arlo is operated by Arlo Technologies, Inc. (“we,” “our,” “us,” or “the Company”). These Terms of Service (“Arlo Terms” or “Terms”) apply to your use of any of our products or services including:</span></p>
<p>the Arlo hardware products, including without limitation: cameras, lights, doorbells, and base station devices (referred to herein as the “Arlo System"); and/or</p>

<span id="service"> </span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="text-image-wrapper cf">
<h5>1. Terms of Service</h5>
</br>
<p>Your registration of the Arlo System through the Arlo Websites as well as use of the Arlo Services is subject to the provisions of these Terms. Arlo may at its discretion change these Terms. Any changes made to the provisions of these Terms will be updated on the Arlo website, and we will notify you, e.g., by sending you an email or displaying a prominent notice in the Arlo Services. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective 30 days after Arlo provides you with notice of any changes to these Terms. If you are dissatisfied with any changes to these Terms you may cancel your Arlo Services in accordance with Section 14 of these Terms. Your use of the Arlo Services on or after the effective date of the change to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of the Terms, as modified. Any software component embodied in the Arlo System is licensed to you, and not sold. Arlo Services cannot be used in the comprehensively sanctioned countries Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria, and the Arlo System should not be sold in these countries.</p>
<p>THE ARLO SYSTEM, WEBSITES AND SERVICES ARE FOR PERSONAL, NONCOMMERCIAL USE ONLY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="text-image-wrapper cf">
<h5>2. Registration Information</h5>
</br>
<p>Registration of your Arlo System is required. To register, you must provide and maintain accurate information, which may include: (i) your name (ii) your system identification number and (iii) an e-mail address. You agree to provide and maintain accurate and complete user information, and Arlo may terminate your account if you provide Arlo with inaccurate or incomplete user information. You also certify that you are legally permitted to use and access the Arlo Services. These Terms are void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Arlo Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Arlo may collect, process, and store your videos and other information. Please review our Privacy Policy located at <a href="https://www.arlo.com/en-us/about/privacy-policy/">https://www.arlo.com/en-us/about/privacy-policy/</a> for details about how we collect, use, and disclose information about you and your Arlo account. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy frequently. You have the right to update certain of your user information. You may also be able to manage privacy settings related to collection, storage, and use of your user information and other types of information captured by the Arlo Services. Any such changes can be made by logging into your Arlo account. Certain features of the Arlo Services may not be available if you restrict the collection, storage, or use of certain types of information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="text-image-wrapper cf">
<h5>3. Member account, password and security</h5>
</br>
<p>You will create a password and account designation during the Arlo Service's registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to properly protect your account by, for example, exiting from or logging out of your account at the end of each session. You will also immediately notify us of unauthorized use of your password or account.</p>
<p>We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 3. We may refuse registration of or cancel Arlo account designation in its discretion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="text-image-wrapper cf">
<h5>4. Third-Party content</h5>
</br>
<p>The Arlo Services give you the ability to access media content controlled by third parties ("Third-Party Content") over which we exercise no editorial or programming control. You understand the following:</p>
<p>(a) Third-Party Content providers may restrict or revoke access to their content at any time;</p>
<p>(b) To the extent possible under the governing law, we are not responsible for and have no editorial control over any Third-Party Content; and</p>
<p>(c) ARLO has no control over the distribution of Third-Party Content.</p>
<p>You agree that we will have no liability to you or anyone else who uses your Arlo System with regard to any Third-Party Content. You also agree and declare that any and all Third-Party Content accessed or transferred using the Arlo Services is for personal, non-commercial use and that the Arlo Services will not be used to illegally copy, illegally display, or otherwise make illegal use of Third-Party Content. Generally, authorization from the appropriate rights holder is needed prior to displaying, using, or copying Third-Party Content. Unauthorized copying or distribution of copyrighted works may constitute an infringement of the copyright holders' rights.</p>
<p>We may terminate the accounts of users of any Arlo service or software who infringe the copyrights, trademarks, or intellectual property rights of others. In addition, steps intended to defeat or bypass security measures designed to prevent intellectual property infringement may be illegal under U.S. law or comparable foreign laws. We may terminate the Arlo accounts of users who develop or use methods to defeat or bypass such security measures and may take any other necessary or appropriate action to prevent infringement of intellectual property holders' rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="text-image-wrapper cf">
<h5>5. Changes to your Arlo Service</h5>
</br>
<p>To the extent possible under the governing law, we may, at our discretion and without notice or user permission, change, add, or remove features and functionality of the Arlo Services. If you are dissatisfied with any material changes to the Arlo Services during a subscription, you may immediately terminate your use of the Arlo Services and be entitled to a pro-rated refund of any of your paid for, but unused, subscription. We are under no obligation to provide any or all features and functionality to your Arlo System and may, at our discretion, discontinue the provision of software updates to certain Arlo Systems. Because different Arlo Systems may support different features and functionality, the level of service we provide may not be the same for each Arlo System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="text-image-wrapper cf">
<h5>6. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.</h5>
</br>
<p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND THE COMPANY ARE EACH AGREEING TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND ARE THEREFORE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">BINDING ARBITRATION.</span> To the extent possible under your local law, both you and the Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes or claims out of or relating to this Agreement, any Arlo Services, or your relationship to Arlo. All disputes concerning whether a claim is subject to arbitration (including disputes about the interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability, or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury to resolve claims. Arbitration is less formal than a traditional court proceeding and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts.</p>
<p>The arbitration will be governed and administered by the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and consumer contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. To the extent JAMS is not available in your state, the arbitration will be governed and administered by the American Arbitration Association Consumer Arbitration Rules. The right to arbitration under this Agreement is protected by, and any arbitration will also be governed by, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq.). Both parties agree that the parties’ relationship involves interstate commerce. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">EXCEPTIONS TO ARBITRATION.</span> Not withstanding the foregoing, each party will have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of this Agreement, for any dispute between the parties that is not subject to arbitration, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Northern District of California.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">CLASS ACTION WAIVER. The parties agree that they both give up the right to a jury trial, and that each may bring claims against the other only on an individual basis, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit: CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER ARE OPTIONAL.</span> You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to <a href="mailto:legal@arlo.com">legal@arlo.com</a> within thirty (30) calendar days of agreeing to these Terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<div class="text-image-wrapper cf">
<h5>10. Subscription Services Fees and Automatic Renewal</h5>
</br>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Activation.</span>To activate your Arlo Service, you must affirmatively take certain steps – this activation will not occur automatically. For new Arlo users, this will involve creating an Arlo account as part of the sign-up process.<p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Subscription Services Fees. SOME ARLO SERVICES REQUIRE AN ONGOING SUBSCRIPTION THAT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL YOU CANCEL, OR WE TERMINATE, THE RELATED SERVICE.</span>You agree to pay your subscription fee in advance. Your subscription period is stated in your Arlo subscription plan, which you may view by logging into your account. Your subscription fee will cover the Arlo Services provided in your Arlo subscription plan. You may have a choice of subscription payment options and may change your selected payment option by notifying us in accordance with the subscription plan. If for any reason you need to reactivate a terminated subscription you may be charged a reactivation fee that will be disclosed to you prior to the levy of the reactivation fee. Whatever your subscription payment option, your subscription fee does not include any services, features, or functionality other than the Arlo Services as defined in the plan you choose. We may offer multiple subscription plans with varying levels and services.<p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Free Gifts and Trials. Your subscription may start with a free trial or promotional subscription fee that automatically converts to a full-priced paid subscription upon expiration of the trial or promotional period. If so, UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD, WE WILL BEGIN BILLING YOUR PAYMENT METHOD ON A RECURRING BASIS FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FEE (PLUS ANY APPLICABLE TAXES) UPON EXPIRATION OF THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD UNTIL YOU CANCEL OR WE TERMINATE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION.</span>You may not receive a notice from us that your free trial has ended or that the paid portion of your subscription has begun. We reserve the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="text-image-wrapper cf">
<h5>11. Subscription Payment and Automatic Renewal</h5>
</br>
<p>To sign up for a subscription option with recurring payments, complete the required registration details online, including without limitation selecting your method of payment and checking the box to automatically renew your service plan. If you choose a subscription option with recurring payments (i.e. the monthly and annual subscriptions) you agree that we may automatically charge the subscription fee to the credit or charge card provided and associated with your account at the beginning of each period at the frequency you have selected unless and until you cancel the subscription option by unchecking the auto-renewal option in your Arlo account settings at <a href="https://www.arlo.com/au/about/terms-and-conditions/my.arlo.com?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=staging-na01-arlo.demandware.net&amp;utm_campaign=(not set)&amp;utm_content=undefined">my.arlo.com</a> or canceling your Arlo Services. You must cancel prior to the subscription fee being charged to the credit or charge card. If you signed up at a promotional rate any renewals past the promotional period will be charged at the then effective subscription fee. Access to your Arlo Services will not be established until the Company or its agent has verified that the credit card information is valid, accurate, and that your credit card account is in good standing.</p>
<p>Instructions for canceling your subscription are described below in this Section 11. We reserve the right to modify or terminate free trials at any time, without notice and in our sole discretion.</p>
<p>You also acknowledge that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers, changes to your Subscription or changes in applicable taxes or other charges, and you authorize us (or our third-party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount.</p>
<p>To the extent possible under the governing law, we may also change the Arlo Services fees or charge additional fees for features and functionalities that are not a part of the Arlo Services. Such fee changes and additional charges will generally not take place until the renewal date for your subscription. We will notify you by an email to the email address on record for your account in advance of any fee changes or new fees. If you are dissatisfied with the fee changes or additional charges, you may terminate your use of the Arlo Services because of the implementation of such fee changes or additional charges and be entitled to a pro-rated refund of any of your paid for, but unused, fees for using the Arlo Services.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cancellation Policy and Procedure</span></br>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Cancellation Policy. Your subscription will automatically renew until you cancel. You may cancel your subscription by unchecking the auto-renewal option in your Arlo account settings at my.arlo.com or contacting the Support Center at <a href="https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/contact.aspx">https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/contact.aspx</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Refund Policy. Unless refunds are specifically not allowed under the particular subscription plan, such as a subscription plan implementing discounted rates in return for a longer subscription term commitment, if you cancel your subscription before the end of the subscription term then a prorated refund is automatically credited to your original method of payment. You may cancel your subscription by unchecking the auto-renewal option in your Arlo account settings at my.arlo.com or contacting the Support Center at <a href="https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/contact.aspx">https://www.arlo.com/en-us/support/contact.aspx</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Termination of Service.</span></br>
<p>We may suspend or terminate your Arlo Services without notice upon rejection of any credit card charges or if your card issuer (or its agent or affiliate) seeks the return of payments previously made to us for Arlo Services. You agree we may charge interest on all amounts due that remain unpaid for 30 days or more. The monthly interest will equal 1.5% of the past due amount or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, until the past due amount and interest is paid. Such rights are in addition to and not in lieu of any other legal rights or remedies available to the Company. We may refer your account to a third party for collection in the event of ongoing default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h5>14. Termination of service</h5>
</br>
