<p><b>You control who sees your cameras and content.</b> Arlo is designed to provide a way for you to view the content captured with your Arlo cameras, including your videos and photos taken with your Arlo cameras. You control access to your cameras and stored content. The Arlo video monitoring systems come with various services plans, which may offer: remote viewing of your Arlo cameras&rsquo; content; automatic recording when motion is detected; motion alerts (with links to the associated videos); video clips that are sent to your iPhone, iPad, Android phone, or tablet; digital pan and zoom; video storage; and the ability to support multiple cameras. Through settings in your Arlo account you can choose to keep your cameras, photos and videos private or allow broader access to them. Premium service plans may be offered that upgrade the aforementioned features or add additional features to your Arlo system.</p>

You must cancel prior to the subscription fee being charged to the credit or charge card. If you signed up at a promotional rate any renewals past the promotional period will be charged at the then effective subscription fee.

You agree ARLO may charge interest on all amounts due that remain unpaid for 30 days or more. The monthly interest will equal 1.5% of the past due amount or the highest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, until the past due amount and interest is paid. Such rights are in addition to and not in lieu of any other legal rights or remedies available to ARLO.

Termination of the Arlo Services may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your membership, including Content.</p>
<p>All provisions of these Terms which, by their nature, should survive termination, will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.</p>

<h5>22. Warranty and Warranty disclaimer</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ARLO has a limited warranty on the Arlo cameras and base station devices whereby ARLO warrants to and only to you that the Arlo cameras and base station devices will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for one (1) year from the date of your purchase of the Arlo cameras and base station devices (unless a longer warranty period is required by law). The specifics of this ARLO Limited Warranty are at <a href="https://www.arlo.com/en-us/about/warranty/default.aspx">https://www.arlo.com/en-us/ about/warranty/default.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>Batteries and battery replacement is excluded from all Arlo warranties. It is your sole responsibility to maintain and replace the Arlo batteries. ARLO recommends that you carefully read and follow the owner&rsquo;s manual, instructions and warnings for all Arlo equipment. Use of only high-quality, non-counterfeit, and non-rechargeable batteries is recommended. The use of rechargeable batteries or inferior-quality batteries that cause damage to your Arlo camera system will void the warranty. Repair or modification of the product by anyone other than ARLO or a ARLO approved agent will void the warranty.</p>
<p>TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE UNDER GOVERNING LAW, OTHER THAN THE ABOVE PRODUCT WARRANTY FOR THE ARLO CAMERAS AND BASE STATION DEVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE ARLO SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; BASIS. ARLO MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE ARLO SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT USE OF THE ARLO SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR ERROR-FREE NOR DOES ARLO MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY OR RELIABILITY OF ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE ARLO SERVICES (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY CONTENT), THAT ANY DEFECTS IN THE ARLO SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED OR THAT THE ARLO PRODUCTS OR ARLO SERVICES WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH ANY OTHER SPECIFIC HARDWARE OR SERVICE.

ARLO ALSO ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY VIRUSES THAT MAY INFECT YOUR ARLO BASE STATION, COMPUTER SOFTWARE, OR OTHER HARDWARE.</p>
<p>YOU AGREE THAT ARLO IS NOT AN INSURER AND THAT ARLO IS NOT PROVIDING ME WITH INSURANCE OF ANY TYPE. ANY AMOUNTS THAT YOU PAY ARLO FOR THE ARLO SERVICE ARE NOT INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND ARE NOT RELATED TO THE VALUE OF YOUR PROPERTY, ANYONE ELSE&rsquo;S PROPERTY LOCATED IN YOUR PREMISES, OR ANY RISK OF LOSS AT YOUR PREMISES. IF YOU WANT INSURANCE TO PROTECT AGAINST ANY RISK OF LOSS AT YOUR PREMISES, YOU WILL PURCHASE IT. IN THE EVENT OF ANY LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY, YOU WILL NOT LOOK TO ARLO TO COMPENSATE YOU OR ANYONE ELSE. YOU RELEASE AND WAIVE FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR INSURER ALL SUBROGATION AND OTHER RIGHTS TO RECOVER AGAINST ARLO ARISING AS A RESULT OF THE PAYMENT OF ANY CLAIM FOR LOSS, DAMAGE OR INJURY.</p>
<p>ARLO&rsquo;S EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES DO NOT CAUSE AND CANNOT ELIMINATE OCCURRENCES OF CERTAIN EVENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FIRES, FLOODS, BURGLARIES, ROBBERIES AND MEDICAL PROBLEMS. ARLO MAKES NO GUARANTY OR WARRANTY, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, THAT THE ARLO EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES PROVIDED WILL DETECT OR AVERT SUCH INCIDENTS OR THEIR CONSEQUENCES. ARLO DOES NOT UNDERTAKE ANY RISK THAT YOU OR YOUR PROPERTY, OR THE PERSON OR PROPERTY OF OTHERS, MAY BE SUBJECT TO INJURY OR LOSS IF SUCH AN EVENT OCCURS. THE ALLOCATION OF SUCH RISK REMAINS WITH YOU, NOT ARLO.</p>
<p>OTHER THAN THE ABOVE PRODUCT WARRANTY FOR THE ARLO CAMERAS AND BASE STATION DEVICES, ARLO AND ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, REGARDING THE ARLO SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

OTHER THAN AS PERMITTED BY LAW, ARLO DOES NOT EXCLUDE, LIMIT OR SUSPEND OTHER RIGHTS YOU HAVE, INCLUDING THOSE THAT MAY ARISE FROM THE NONCONFORMITY OF A SALES CONTRACT. FOR A FULL UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR RIGHTS YOU SHOULD CONSULT THE LAWS OF YOUR STATE, PROVINCE, OR COUNTRY.

<h5>24. Limitations of Arlo's liability</h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Under no circumstances will ARLO be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, the loss of Content, any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred in connection with use of or exposure to any Content posted, emailed, accessed, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the Arlo Services.</b></p>
<p><b>ARLO&rsquo;s liability for damages, especially for breach of duty or obligation, delay in performance, non-performance, or malperformance shall be precluded, except when these are due to negligent breaches of any significant contractual duty or obligation on the part of ARLO. Any liability for negligence is limited to direct losses usually and typically foreseeable in such case. Should the claim for damages be based on wilful or grossly negligent breach of contractual duty or obligation on the part of ARLO, the preclusion and limitation of liability mentioned in the preceding sentences WIll not apply. The preceding preclusion and limitation of liability WIll also not apply to claims for damages arising out of loss of life, bodily injury or health impacts for which ARLO may be liable, or for non-contractual liability.</b></p>
<p><b>Some states and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Additionally, this provision is not intended to limit ARLO's liability in the event of ARLO's willful or intentional misconduct. Moreover, if ARLO mistakenly or wrongfully overcharges your account, this section does not limit ARLO's ability to refund such mistakenly or wrongfully overcharged amounts.</b></p>

<h5><b>25. General Information</b></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>EEntire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and ARLO and govern your use of the Arlo Services superseding any prior agreements between you and ARLO with respect to the Arlo Services. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use or purchase certain other Arlo Services, affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.</b></p>
<p><b>Choice of Law and Forum. To the extent possible under your local law, these Terms and the relationship between you and Arlo will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</b></p>
<p><b>To the extent possible under your local law, any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement will be finally settled by arbitration in Santa Clara County, California, using the English language in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration an.</b></p>
<p><b>Mediation Services, Inc. (&ldquo;JAMS&rdquo;) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who will be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis: class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</b></p>
<p><b>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND ARLO ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</b></p>

For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in the Northern District of California.</b></p>
<p><b>Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of ARLO to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect.</b></p>
<p><b>No Right of Survivorship and Non-Transferability. You agree that your Arlo account is nontransferable and any rights to your Arlo ID or contents within your account terminate upon your death.

<h5><b>27. Arlo Terms of Service Addendum</b></h5>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>If you are a subscriber to an Arlo Service then the below additional Arlo Service Terms apply.</b></p>
<p><b>Last Updated: November 25, 2019</b></p>
<p><b><b>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY AND IN FULL. THEY CONTAIN CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY AND USE OF THE ARLO SERVICE YOU ARE ACTIVATING (&quot;Arlo Service&quot;)..</b></b></p>
<p><b><u>These &quot;Arlo Service Terms&quot; supplement the Arlo Terms and Conditions (&quot;Arlo Terms&quot; or &quot;Terms&quot;), which will otherwise apply in full force and effect, subject to any additional terms set forth herein. In the event of any inconsistency between the Arlo Service Terms and the Arlo Terms, the terms and provisions of the Arlo Service Terms will govern and control.</u></b></p>
<p><b><b>Activation.</b> To activate your Arlo Service, you must affirmatively take certain steps -this activation will not occur automatically. For new Arlo users, this will involve creating an Arlo account as part of the sign up process. Your use of the Arlo Service will be subject to these Arlo Service Terms, the Arlo Terms, and Arlo's Privacy Policy.</b></p>
<p><b><b>Duration.</b> You may cancel your Arlo Service or delete your Arlo account at any time, upon which you will lose access to the Arlo Service and/ or Arlo account. To take any of these actions, log into your Arlo account and follow the prompts on the account page.</b></p>
<p><b><b>Privacy.</b> If your Arlo Service utilizes facial recognition, object recognition, and other artificial intelligence capabilities then Arlo may capture digital images, videos, sounds, and use information provided by your Arlo system. Arlo automatically may compare these captured images and sounds to databases of stored records. You explicitly agree that such data and other biometric or environmental data may be captured by your Arlo system and used and analyzed by the Arlo Service, but Arlo employees do not view your private images or private videos without your permission. In addition to the above-described information you provide to the Arlo system for use by the Arlo Service, you also acknowledge and agree that you will provide other information to Arlo, such as your email address, physical address, and credit card information. This latter information is for the purpose of activating and administering the Arlo Services.</b></p>
<p><b><b>Payment.</b> The credit card you provide when signing up for the Arlo Service will automatically be charged the current price of the Arlo Service for each subscription period until you cancel. <u>You can cancel the Arlo Service at any time prior to the commencement of the new subscription period, but you will not be provided a pro-rated refund for the current subscription period.</u>If Arlo changes the monthly or other term subscription fee for the Arlo Service in the future, we will provide you advanced notice of the price change and when it will take effect. If not cancelled, price changes will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. By not canceling and continuing to use the Arlo Service after the price change takes effect, you agree to be charged the new price. In other words, after your subscription period ends then the price for the next subscription period could be different, but the price will not be change during your current subscription period.</b></p>
<p><b><b>Limitations on Arlo Smart Service.</b> The Arlo Smart E911 Service will not function (1) with the loss of critical electrical power, including without limitation the loss of power to equipment necessary to route Arlo Smart communications to the appropriate emergency call center; (2) if the wireless or broadband internet connection to your device with the Arlo Smart application is not operational; (3) at a remote location with no internet connection; (4) if the Arlo Smart application is not correctly configured; (5) if the correct physical address for the Arlo E911 Service is not provided; (6) if an emergency call center's technical limitations render it incapable of receiving or processing calls from Arlo E911 Service; and (7) other force majeure events cause the quality of the broadband connection to deteriorate, including without limitation network congestion. Your acceptance of these Arlo Smart Service Terms constitutes your acknowledgement that Arlo has advised you of these potential limitations.</b></p>
<p><b><b>Disclaimer of Liability.</b> We do not have any control over whether, or the manner in which, calls using our Arlo Smart E911 Service are answered or addressed by any local emergency response center. We disclaim all responsibility for the conduct of local emergency response centers and the national emergency calling center. We rely on third parties to assist us in routing Arlo Smart E911 Service communications to local emergency response centers and to a national emergency calling center. We disclaim any and all liability or responsibility in the event such third party data used to route communications is incorrect or yields an erroneous result. Neither Arlo nor its officers or employees may be held liable for any claim, damage, or loss, and you hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action, arising from or relating to our Arlo Service unless such claims or causes of action arose from our gross negligence or willful misconduct.</b></p>
<p><b><b>Additional Services.</b> We may from time to time make additional Arlo services (each an &quot;Additional Service&quot;) available to Arlo customers. In order to access such Additional Services, you may be required to take certain steps, including consent to further terms.</b></p>
