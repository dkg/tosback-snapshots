    <li>
        Phishing
        <p>Online identity theft and account hacking, including the practice currently known as "phishing", are of great concern.

        <p>The Platform may contain links to other websites, services or offers which are owned, operated or maintained by third parties. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third website or service. The fact that we link to a website or service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not have control over third party websites and services and we do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Security

    <li>Your Rights and Choices
        <p>The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
        <p><em>Right to Request Access to Information</em></p>
        <p>You have the right to request that BetterHelp notifies you of the personal information about you that we have collected and used. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see <em>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</em>), we will disclose to you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
            <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
            <li>Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that personal information.</li>
            <li>The categories of third parties with whom we shared that personal information.</li>
            <li>The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.</li>
            <li>If we disclosed your personal information for a business purpose and identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Right to Request Deletion of Information</em></p>
        <p>You have the right to request that BetterHelp deletes any of your personal information that we collected about you and retained. Once we receive your request and verify who you are, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
            <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
            <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
            <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
            <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 <em>seq.</em>).</li>
            <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
            <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
            <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
            <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Exercising Your Rights</em></p>
        <p>To exercise the rights listed above, please submit a request in writing to BetterHelp via the contact information listed in the Contact Information section. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a request related to your personal information. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
        <p>You may only make a request for access twice within a 12-month period. Your request must:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
            <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.</p>
        <p><em>Response Timing and Format</em></p>
        <p>We endeavor to respond to a request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>
        <p>For Requests to Access, our response will only cover the 12-month period preceding the request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. We will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
        <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Non-Discrimination
        <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. We will not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
            <li>Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.</li>
            <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
            <li>Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>Other California Privacy Rights
        <p>California's “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Websites that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to DPO@betterhelp.com.</p>
    </li>

        <p>BetterHelp reserves the right to amend this privacy Notice at our discretion and at any time. When we make changes to this privacy Notice, we will post the updated Notice on the Websites and update the Notice's effective date. Regardless of changes to our Privacy Policy, we will never use the information you submit under our current privacy notice in a new way without first notifying you and giving you the option to opt out.
