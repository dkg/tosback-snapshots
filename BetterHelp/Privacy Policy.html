Login Data does not include the content of any messages sent or received by users or the content of any counseling goals.</p>
        <p><em>Counseling Session Data</em>: BetterHelp collects, uses, and stores certain general data regarding user counseling sessions such as whether a live session has been scheduled by the user, whether a Counselor or user joins a scheduled session, when a counseling session began and ended, and whether a counseling session was canceled or re-scheduled.</p>

    </li>

    <li><div class="title-level2">Cookies and Web Beacons</div>
        <p>Like many websites, we use "cookies" and "web beacons" (also known as pixels) to collect information. A "cookie" is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We collect cookies that are necessary for the Platform to function, cookies that enhance the Platform’s performance, and cookies used for third-party tracking.  A "web beacon" is a tiny and sometimes invisible image or embedded code, placed on a Web page or email that can report your visit or use to a third party. Web beacons are typically used by third parties to monitor the activity of users at a website for the purpose of web analytics, advertising optimization, or page tagging.  Additional information regarding web beacons is available on Wikipedia.</p>
        <p>You can change your browser's settings so it will stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. Opt-out options for cookies are located <a href ="/opt_out/">here</a>.</p>

        <h4>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technology for Analytics</h4>
        <p>We may use third party cookies for the purposes of web analytics, attribution, and error management. Our Platform may use vendor services that use cookies, web beacons, and similar technology to collect and store anonymous information about you, including when you pay for services, load a page, indicate that you heard about us on television, sign up for services, enter your payment information (but the payment details are not disclosed), start the intake questionnaire, and your response as to the referral source to the Platform.</p>
        <p>Our Platform also uses analytics vendors to collect information (for example, Visitor Data and Onboarding Data) about user actions on our websites for purposes of analytics and analysis of certain Platform usage.</p>

        <h4>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technology for Advertising Networks</h4>
        <p>You and others may see certain ads for our services or for the Platform on other websites because we participate in ad networks. Ad networks allow us to target our messaging to users through demographic, interest-based, and contextual means. These networks track individuals’ online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs, and web beacons. The networks use this information to show advertisements that may be tailored to an individual’s interests. The information our ad networks may collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the relevant ad networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our websites and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and assists other websites and advertising partners to find you or people like you on different platforms, including social media websites.</p>
    </li>

    <li><div class="title-level2">Social and General Information Tools</div>
        <p>We use several publicly-available tools and information exchange resources, such as (but not limited to) a blog, a Facebook page, a Twitter account, and others (collectively "Social and General Information Tools"). Any information you provide or share while using Social and General Information Tools may be read, accessed, collected by that site and users of that site according to their Privacy Policy.</p>
    </li>

    <li><div class="title-level2">Phishing</div>
        <p>Online identity theft and account hacking, including the practice currently known as "phishing", are of great concern. You should always be diligent when you are being asked for your account information and you must always make sure you do that in our secure system. We will never request your login information or your credit card information in any non-secure or unsolicited communication (email, phone or otherwise).</p>
    </li>

    <li><div class="title-level2">Links</div>
        <p>The Platform may contain links to other websites, services or offers which are owned, operated or maintained by third parties. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third website or service. The fact that we link to a website or service is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not have control over third party websites and services and we do not have control over their privacy policies and terms of use.</p>
    </li>

    <li><div class="title-level2">Security of Information</div>
        <p>While using any Internet-based service carries inherent security risks that cannot be 100% prevented, our systems, infrastructure, encryption technology, operation and processes are all designed, built and maintained with your security and privacy in mind. We apply industry standards and best practices to prevent any unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. We comply with all applicable federal laws, state laws, and regulations regarding data privacy.</p>
    </li>

    <li><div class="title-level2">Service Providers</div>
        <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Platform, to perform certain tasks which are related to the Platform, or to provide audit, legal, operational or other services for us. These tasks include, but not limited to, customer service, technical maintenance, monitoring, email management and communication, database management, billing and payment processing, reporting and analytics. We will share with them only the minimum necessary information to perform their task for us and only after entering into appropriate confidentiality agreements.</p>
    </li>

    <li><div class="title-level2">Children's Privacy</div>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect or solicit any information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to become our user. The Platform is not directed and not intended to be used by children under the age of 13.

    <li><div class="title-level2">Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</div>
        <p>We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose information necessary or appropriate to protect the safety of the public or any person, to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), and to prevent or stop activity that may be illegal or dangerous. You should also be aware that Counselors may be obliged to disclose information to law enforcement or other authorities to conform to their professional and legal responsibilities. Specifically, and without limitation, you should be aware that the law requires mental health professionals to disclose information and/or take action in the following cases: (a) reported or suspected abuse of a child or vulnerable adult; (b) serious suicidal potential; (c) threatened harm to another person; (d) court-ordered presentation of treatment.</p>

Once we receive your request and verify who you are, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>

            <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>

<h1>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Notice</h1>
<p>This section provides additional information about our Privacy Policy relevant to users from the European Union (EU) and Switzerland. It supplements and should be read in conjunction with the rest of the Privacy Policy. Under the GDPR, BetterHelp is the Controller with respect to your Personal Data.</p>
<p>BetterHelp may use your personal information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>When it is necessary to do so to perform our obligations in accordance with any contract that we may have with you, for example to manage your account, and to respond to enquiries about your use of the Platform.</li>
    <li>When it is in our legitimate interests or a third party's legitimate interests to use personal information in such a way to ensure that we provide the Platform in the best way that we can. In particular, we have a legitimate interest in using your personal information for product development and internal analytics purposes, and otherwise to improve the safety, security, and performance of the Platform. We only rely on our or a third party's legitimate interests to process your personal information when these interests are not overridden by your rights and interests.</li>
    <li>When it is necessary to do so in order to comply with any legal obligations imposed upon us, for example under applicable law.</li>
    <li>When you have consented to the use of your personal information, for example for marketing purposes or to track your online activities via Cookies and similar technologies.</li>
</ul>
<ol class="privacy-terms-list">
    <li>Your Rights and Choices
        <p>EU and Swiss residents have specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your rights if you are resident in the EU or Switzerland, and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>
        <p><em>Right of access</em>: You may be entitled to ask us for a copy of any personal information which we hold. This right is known as a ‘Subject Access Request.’ We will normally send you a copy of the personal information within one month of your request. However, that period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity of the request or the difficulty in accessing the personal information that you request. There is usually no charge; but in exceptional circumstances we may charge but will discuss this with you if those circumstances apply.</p>
        <p><em>Right to rectification</em>: If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request rectification. The personal information will be checked, and, where appropriate, inaccuracies will be rectified.</p>
        <p><em>Right to erasure</em>: In certain circumstances, you may be entitled to ask us to erase your personal information.</p>
        <p><em>Right to data portability</em>: In certain circumstances, you may wish to move, copy, or transfer the electronic personal Information that we hold about you to another organization.</p>
        <p><em>Right to object</em>: You may object to your personal information being used for direct marketing. You may object to the continued use of your personal information in any circumstances where we rely upon consent as the legal basis for processing it. Where we rely upon legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing your personal information, you may object to us continuing to process your personal information, but you must give us specific reasons for objecting. We will consider the reasons you provide, but if we consider that there are compelling legitimate grounds for us to continue to process your personal information, we may continue to do so. In that event, we will let you know the reasons for our decision.</p>
        <p><em>Rights related to automated decision-making including profiling</em>: We use limited personal information to operate the Platform and to carry out certain profiling activities to support and grow our business.  When doing so, we rely upon our legitimate interests as the lawful basis for processing your personal information and you may exercise the above rights if you do not wish us to process your personal information in this way.</p>
        <p>To exercise the rights in relation to your Personal Information set out in this section, please contact us by clicking <a href ="/contact/">here</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>International Data Transfers
        <p>The Platform is controlled and operated by us from the United States. By accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy you agree that any personal information you provide to us through use of the Platform may be stored and processed, transferred between and accessed from the United States and other countries that may not guarantee the same level of protection of personal  information  as the one in which you reside. However, we will handle your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy at all times.</p>
        <p>You can contact our Data Protection Officer with questions, about this policy, or about your personal information by writing to:</p>
