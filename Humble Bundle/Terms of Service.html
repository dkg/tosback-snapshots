    INCORPORATE BY REFERENCE THE HUMBLE BUNDLE PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER WITH
    ANY UPDATES OR ADDITIONAL TERMS, THE TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY ARE
    COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE "AGREEMENT"). IF YOU DOWNLOAD

  <p>
    <a href="#new-jersey">SECTION 6</a> CONTAINS AN IMPORTANT NOTE TO NEW JERSEY CONSUMERS.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>1. USE OF SERVICE</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(a) Eligibility.</u> You may use the Service only if you can form a binding
    contract with Company, and only in compliance with this Agreement and
    all applicable local, state, national, and foreign laws, rules and
    regulations. If your minor children use the Service, you are solely
    responsible for such use, including, without limitation, any purchases
    your minor children make through the Service. Any use or access to the
    Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this
    Agreement and you agree that you will not allow your minor children under
    the age of 13 to engage in such use. You may not use the Service if you
    have previously been removed or banned from the Service by Humble Bundle.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(b) Restrictions.</u> You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited
    activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the
    Service in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or
    non-automated "scraping"; (ii) using any automated system, including
    without limitation "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc., to access
    the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Company
    servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by
    using a conventional on-line web browser (except that Humble Bundle grants
    the operators of public search engines revocable permission to use spiders
    to copy materials from Humble Bundle for the sole purpose of and solely to
    the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of
    the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials); (iii)
    transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv)
    attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security
    or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service;
    (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose in our sole judgment an
    unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi)
    uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through
    the Service; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable
    information, including account names, from the Service; (viii) using the
    Service for any commercial solicitation purposes; (ix) impersonating
    another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person
    or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity;
    (x) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (xi) accessing any
    content on the Service through any technology or means other than those
    provided or authorized by the Service; (xii) bypassing the measures we may
    use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without
    limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content
    or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein; (xiii)
    sell, assign, rent, lease, act as a service bureau, or grant rights in the
    Products, including, without limitation, through sublicense, to any other
    entity without the prior written consent of such Products' (defined below)
    licensors; (xiv) circumventing Service limitations on the number of Products
    you may purchase, including, without limitation, creating multiple accounts
    and purchasing a total number of Products through such multiple accounts
    which exceed the per-user limitations; or
    (xv) except as otherwise specifically set forth in a licensor's end user
    license agreement, as otherwise agreed upon by a licensor in writing or as
    otherwise allowed under applicable law, distributing, transmitting, copying
    (other than re-installing software or files previously purchased by you
    through the Service on computers, mobile or tablet devices owned by you, or
    creating backup copies of such software or files for your own personal use)
    or otherwise exploiting the Products (defined below) in any manner other
    than for your own private, non-commercial, personal use. Accessing the
    audiovisual content available on the Service for any purpose or in any
    manner other than Streaming (as defined below) is expressly prohibited.
    "Streaming" means a contemporaneous digital transmission of an audiovisual
    work via the Internet from the Service to a user's device in such a manner
    that the data is intended for real-time viewing and not intended to be
    copied, stored, permanently downloaded, or redistributed by the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT HUMBLE BUNDLE HAS THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT IN ITS
    SOLE DISCRETION, WITHOUT ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OF ANY KIND AND IN ADDITION
    TO ALL OF ITS OTHER RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, IN LAW AND AT EQUITY, TO
    CANCEL ANY AND ALL DOWNLOAD PAGES, PRODUCT KEYS OR REDEMPTION CODES FOR
    PRODUCTS YOU HAVE PURCHASED SHOULD HUMBLE BUNDLE DETERMINE IN ITS SOLE
    DISCRETION THAT YOU HAVE VIOLATED ANY OF THESE RESTRICTIONS.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(c) Termination of Service or Access.</u>
    We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop facilitating the
    Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create
    usage limits for the Service, including, without limitation, limiting the
    number of Products you may purchase at any given time or under any given
    account or set of accounts. We may permanently or temporarily terminate
    or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for
    any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any
    provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any
    reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(d) Your Information.</u> The Service is only for sales of products or product
    rights (collectively, "Products") to end user customers for their personal,
    non-commercial use. The personal information you submit to the Service is
    subject to Humble Bundle's Privacy Policy at
    <a href="/privacy">humblebundle.com/privacy</a>, which is expressly made
    part of these Terms. You agree to provide accurate, current, and
    complete information required to register with the Service and at other
    points as may be required in the course of using the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you make a purchase, you will receive a unique download page. You
    shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose the unique URL for your
    download page to anyone else or use anyone else's download page. You are
    solely and entirely responsible for all activities that occur on your
    download page. Humble Bundle shall not be responsible for any losses
    arising out of the unauthorized use of your download page.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(e) Objectionable Material.</u> You understand that by using the Service and
    Products, you may encounter content that may be deemed mature,
    offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be
    identified as having explicit language or adult themes, and which may be
    due to the content of the Products or your interactions with other users in
    the course of using the Products. You agree to use the Service at your sole
    risk and that Humble Bundle shall have no liability to you for content that
    may be found to be mature, offensive, indecent, or objectionable.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(f) Product Requirements.</u> Use of the Service and/or Products requires a
    compatible computer, Internet access (fees may apply), and certain software
    (fees may apply), and may require obtaining patches, updates or upgrades
    from time to time. Because use of the Service and/or Products involves
    hardware, software, and Internet access (high speed Internet access is
    strongly recommended), your ability to use the Service and/or Products may
    be affected by these factors. You are responsible for being aware of any
    particular system requirements of any Product and for your ability to meet
    such requirements, which may change from time to time. Applicable system
    requirements at the time of purchase can be found on the information page
    for each Product. Certain Products also may require you to register an
    account with a third party (which may require an initial and/or ongoing
    fee) or to install third party software and content in connection with
    their use. Humble Bundle does not assume any responsibility or liability
    for any such fee, account or third party software or content. Physical
    copies Products are not available. If you are having difficulty downloading
    the Product or encounter any other issues with the purchase, download or
    activation of a Product, you should contact us at
    <a href="https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/requests/new">https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/requests/new</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2. PAYMENT, DELIVERY, AND REFERRALS</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In these Terms, "total amount paid" means the amount collected from the User
    which includes the purchase price together with any amount donated to charity
    plus any applicable taxes and "purchase price" means the price of the Product
    plus any applicable taxes, and HB 'tip' where applicable.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(a) Pricing of Products.</u>
    Your purchase price will include the price of the Product plus any applicable
    taxes in effect on the time of purchase, and based on country
    data you provide on your download page. Humble Bundle reserves the right to
    change prices and availability of Products at any time. If you are not
    located in either the US or the EU your purchase price will be the full
    amount of the price posted and failure on Humble Bundle's part to invoice
    you for any applicable
    taxes does not relieve you of the liability to pay such taxes, and you must
    pay to the applicable taxing authority any such taxes which may be due as a
    result of your purchase through the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(b) Orders.</u> Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation
    does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute
    confirmation of our offer to sell. Humble Bundle reserves the right at any
    time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any
    reason. We may require additional verification or information before
    accepting any order.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(c) Payment for Products.</u> The Service uses PayPal, and other payment providers
    as may be indicated on the purchase page. You agree to pay for all Products
    you purchase through the Service, and that Humble Bundle may charge your
    chosen payment method (such as PayPal, Amazon Payments,
    or a deduction from your Humble Wallet) for any Products
    purchased, and for any additional amounts (including any taxes, late
    fees, and any amounts donated to charity as applicable) as may be accrued by
    or in connection with your
    account. All fees will be billed to the payment method you designate during
    the checkout process. Billing to your selected payment method occurs at the
    time of purchase. If you use the services of an alternate payment method
    provider such as PayPal, you will be bound by that party's terms and
    conditions, which are available on that party's website. You also may be
    required to create an account with such payment method provider and to
    provide that payment method provider with your credit card or other
    details. Humble Bundle reserves the right to change the payment methods
    offered at any time. All information that you provide in connection with a
    purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the
    Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all
    charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment
    method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary
    transaction interaction with the Service at the prices in effect when such
    charges are incurred. You will pay any applicable taxes, if any, relating
    to any such purchases, transactions or other monetary transaction
    interactions.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(d) Humble Wallet.</u> You may elect to participate in Company's Humble
    Wallet service offering (the "Humble Wallet") to purchase certain Products.
    Company grants you a limited license to acquire, use, and redeem the Humble
    Wallet service offering pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. You may
    place funds in the Humble Wallet up to an amount to be designated by Company
    through one or more payment providers as further set forth in Section 2(c)
    above. Currently, the maximum balance you may have in the Humble Wallet at
    any given time is the equivalent of $250.00 USD and the total amount of all
    transactions through the Humble Wallet per 24-hour period is equivalent to
    $2,000 USD. There may be a delay between the time you place funds into the
    Humble Wallet and your ability to purchase Products with the Humble Wallet.
    Any purchases made through the Humble Wallet are non-refundable, unless
    otherwise required by law. To the extent that Company makes any changes to
    the balance caps or usage of the Humble Wallet, Company shall post such
    changes to this website. Your use of the Service thirty (30) days following
    the date such changes go into effect constitutes your acceptance of those
    changes.  Should you not agree to such proposed changes, your only remedy is
    to cease your use of the Service. Any balance in the Humble Wallet is strictly
    non-refundable and non-transferrable, unless otherwise required by law, and no
    Humble Wallet balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (FDIC). Additionally, any balance in the Humble Wallet does not
    constitute personal property, has no cash value outside of the Service.
    Company shall not send you any statements with regard to
    transactions made through your Humble Wallet. You are responsible for verifying
    your Humble Wallet balance and reviewing purchases made through the Service.
    To check your Humble Wallet balance, go to
    <a href="/user/wallet">humblebundle.com/user/wallet</a> and enter
    your account information. Any Humble Wallet balances that are deemed unclaimed
    property may be turned over to the applicable governmental authority. Not all
    Products or other aspects of the Service are for purchase through the Humble
    Wallet. You are responsible for confirming that the particular Products you
    wish to purchase are purchasable with the Humble Wallet prior to placing funds
    into the Humble Wallet.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(e) Humble Choice Subscription.</u> The Humble Choice subscription is a series of Products based on available plans and provided as a monthly subscription. If you have subscribed to a Humble Choice subscription plan and have provided us with your payment information, you authorize us to charge you a monthly membership fee at the then current subscription rate for the Humble Choice plan you have selected. You acknowledge that the Humble Choice subscription plan terms and rates for each available plan are subject to change and you agree to pay the applicable subscription rate unless you cancel the subscription, as described in this section. We will notify Humble Choice subscribers of any price changes to their selected plan and any material changes in subscription terms via email prior to implementing the change. Humble Choice subscription plan information is located at: <a href="/subscription">https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      We will automatically charge the applicable Humble Choice subscription fee to your selected payment method within seven (7) days from the closest business day to the date on which that month's Humble Choice bundle availability ends.
    </b>
    The Humble Choice bundle is typically distributed on the first Friday of every month; however, this date may be subject to change at our discretion from time to time. We have the right to change your payment method provided and the date on which your billing cycle occurs. An example of when we may do so is if we cannot successfully settle your account with the original payment method you provided. You are responsible for all charges to your account, including any unpaid charges that occurred prior to the date you cancel your account.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>
      By subscribing to a Humble Choice subscription plan, you hereby request that the Products are delivered or made available for download to you before the expiry of any applicable cancellation period, and you acknowledge that you will lose your right to change your mind and request a refund once the first Product has been made available to you as part of your selected Humble Choice subscription plan.
    </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    From time to time, Humble may run a limited time promotion to receive a discounted or free month of Humble Choice. New and active subscribers may be eligible. Promotions cannot be combined with any other discount or offer. Limit one per customer. If you redeem the discounted or free month of Humble Choice, you will be billed that amount for the month in which you redeem such discounted or free month. Going forward, you will automatically be billed the full price depending on the promotion used and the tier of Humble Choice you select unless you pause or cancel your subscription. Humble will send an e-mail reminder before your subscription renews. Some exclusions may apply. You acknowledge and agree that any such discounting pricing may be subject to change or terminated at any time in Humble's sole discretion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Humble Choice active subscribers may be eligible for certain discounts on Humble Store purchases, as displayed in the Humble Store. The discount is only available to active subscribers and expires when a user unsubscribes or pauses their subscription. Some exclusions may apply. You acknowledge and agree that any such discounting pricing may be subject to change or terminated at any time in Humble's sole discretion.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may cancel your subscription to Humble Choice by going to the Humble Bundle website at <a href="/">www.humblebundle.com</a>, logging into your account and clicking on "Manage My Subscription" through the account settings page. To prevent being charged for Humble Choice for a given calendar month, you must cancel your subscription at least seven (7) days prior to the next upcoming Humble Choice bundle distribution. For example, if the Humble Choice bundle distribution is to occur on March 8, then you must cancel prior to March 1 to ensure that you are not charged for the month of March. PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS.
  </p>
  <p>
    NOTE: Humble Monthly subscribers active as of December 6, 2019 at 10:00 am Pacific time will automatically be transferred to the Humble Choice Classic plan. More information is available here: <a href="https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/articles/360036658733">https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/articles/360036658733</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(f) Charitable Sales Promotions.</u> Under the terms of its charitable sales
    promotions, Humble Bundle will remit all funds designated for a particular
    charity, less any applicable taxes, purchaser refunds/credits, and
    processing fees in accordance with the instructions of the customer.
    There are no minimum or maximum amounts which Humble
    Bundle will remit to a particular charity under the terms of its charitable
    sales promotions. Humble Bundle will not have use of the funds which are
    designated for a charity by the customer. Humble Bundle typically makes
    donations to donor-directed funds like PayPal Giving Fund, with a
    corresponding recommendation that they regrant the funds to the charity
    designated by the customer. The fund will make every effort to grant the
    funds to the designated charity but, like all donor-directed funds, retains
    ultimate discretion and control over the use of the donations it receives
    from Humble Bundle, and may redirect funds to a similar qualifying
    charitable organization if it is unable to follow the recommendation. You
    will not be entitled to a tax deduction for contributions made by Humble
    Bundle to any charity or donor-directed fund.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(g) Bundles.</u> The Humble Bundle "Bundle" offering allows you to determine
    the price that you will pay for a bundle of various Products offered during
    a given time by Humble Bundle (each, a "Bundle"). Each Bundle has various
    suggested prices for groupings of Products. If you want to pay a different
    amount from one of the recommended prices, you may do so by clicking on the
    "Custom Amount" button and entering the price you wish to pay for the
    particular Bundle. Additional Products may be included in a Bundle if you
    pay over a certain price as designated for that Bundle. If the custom
    amount you set is less than the required price to receive these additional
    Products, those Products will not be included in the Bundle you purchase.
    You may determine what portion of the total amount paid for a Bundle is
    attributed to (i) the rights holders of the Bundle Products; (ii) various
    charities as presented through the Bundle; and (iii) Humble Bundle as a tip
    for making the Service available. To designate how you wish for your total
    amount paid to be split, click on the "Choose where your money goes" icon
    and then adjust the sliders to the positions you choose. If you do not
    adjust the sliders, then the amount you pay will be split according to the
    defaults set by Humble Bundle. Note that (A) the tip paid to Humble Bundle
    and (B) the amount to be paid to the various charities, are both optional;
    should you wish not to provide a tip or not to pay any amount to a charity,
    you may set the respective slider to $0.00.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(h) Electronic Signatures and Contracts.</u> Your use of the Service includes the
    ability to enter into agreements and/or to make purchases electronically.
    YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT
    AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY SUCH AGREEMENTS AND TO PAY FOR SUCH PURCHASES.
    YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS APPLIES TO
    ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON THIS SITE,
    INCLUDING NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS, AND APPLICATIONS.
    In order to access and retain your electronic records, you may be required
    to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility.
    These Terms do not confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than
    you or Humble Bundle. You may also have additional rights under applicable
    law.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(i) Delivery of Products.</u> On occasion, technical problems may delay, interrupt
    or prevent the download or activation of your Product. Your exclusive and
    sole remedy with respect to any Product that is not downloadable or able to
    be activated within a reasonable period will be either replacement of such
    Product, store credit or refund, as determined by Humble Bundle in its sole discretion. Humble
    Bundle shall have no liability for issues encountered with downloading,
    activating or using Products due to factors beyond its control, including
    your computer's performance and the speed of your internet connection. In
    some cases certain Products may be games that are still in development. You
    understand that in some instances Product release dates may be delayed and
    that release dates and times posted on the Service are only estimates, and
    you will not be entitled to any refund for a delayed product release date.
    Our obligation to deliver any Product to you shall be complete at the time
    when and place where you first receive the information necessary to
    commence downloading such Product. In all circumstances it is your
    responsibility to ensure that the Product is correctly and completely
    installed on your computer. Once a Product is purchased and you receive the
    Product, it is your responsibility to keep the Product from being
    misplaced, damaged or destroyed, and Humble Bundle shall be without
    liability to you in the event of any loss, damage or destruction. Humble
    Bundle encourages all its users to appropriately back up the Product files
    and any other elements associated with the Products.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(j) No Ongoing Obligations.</u> Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms,
    Humble Bundle and its licensors reserve the right, without liability to
    you, to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Products,
    content, or other materials comprising a part of or sold through the
    Service at any time without notice. You acknowledge that some aspects of
    the Service, Products, and administering of our usage rules entails the
    ongoing involvement of Humble Bundle. Accordingly, in the event that Humble
    Bundle changes any part of the Service or discontinues the Service, which
    Humble Bundle may do at its election, you acknowledge that you may no
    longer be able to use Products to the same extent as prior to such change
    or discontinuation, and that Humble Bundle shall have no liability to you
    in such case. You understand that nothing in these Terms entitles you to
    any future updates, versions or enhancements to any Product (although
    Humble Bundle may offer such updates, versions or enhancements at its sole
    discretion). The Service is not part of any other product or offering, and
    no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to
    represent or guarantee you access to the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(k) Refer A Friend.</u> You may refer friends to subscribe to Humble Choice by sending them a link available on your settings page at <a href="/user/settings">https://www.humblebundle.com/user/settings</a>. Humble Bundle may provide you, at its discretion, with a reward for each friend you refer to us who subscribes to Humble Choice. To the extent that Humble Bundle is offering rewards for referrals, the current reward is displayed on your settings page. The maximum number of rewards for referrals is set at Humble Bundle's discretion and indicated on your setting page. You will be able to see the number of rewards that you have received on your settings page. Humble Bundle may suspend or terminate the Refer A Friend Beta at any time at its sole and absolute discretion.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>4. TERM AND TERMINATION</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <u>(a) Termination by Humble Bundle.</u> If you fail, or Humble Bundle, in its sole
    and absolute discretion, determines or suspects that you have failed, to
    comply with any of these Terms, including but not limited to failure to
    make payment of fees due, failure to provide Humble Bundle with a valid
    payment method, failure to safeguard your download page, or violation of
    our usage rules or any license to the software, Humble Bundle, at its sole
    discretion, without notice to you may: (i) terminate these Terms and/or
    your download page, and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to
    and including the date of termination; and/or (ii) terminate the license to
    the software; and/or (iii) preclude access to the Service (or any part
