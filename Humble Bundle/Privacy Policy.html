Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.</p>
<p>With respect to surveys, in the event that responses are publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey. Otherwise we will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users' responses in surveys to other participants in the survey. Where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where Humble Bundle advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, Humble Bundle reserves the right to disclose any information provided by users, provided that no User Information identifying a specific user is disclosed.</p>

<p>Some of our advertisers may use third party advertising service companies to serve advertisements, for OBA or otherwise, and perform related services when you interact with the Channels. Often, these third party advertising companies employ cookies and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of website, app and email advertisements and to create a record of interaction with our content that they use in conjunction with their advertising which appears on other sites or applications, or for reporting website traffic, app use, statistics, advertisement data and/or other activities on the Services. We also engage third party providers to assist with the segmentation of this data.</p>

<p>We may engage third party providers to assist with the collection, storage and segmentation of Online Data and the providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of this information.  These third party providers may collect User Information from our Services for their own purposes, such as to monitor fraud around the web.</p>

<p>If we engage a third-party Processor to Process your User Information, the Processor will be subject to binding contractual obligations to: (i) only Process the User Information in accordance with our prior written instructions; and (ii) use measures to protect the confidentiality and security of the User Information; together with any additional requirements under applicable law.</p>

<p>The Services contain links to other sites or partners whose information practices may be different from ours. You should consult the privacy policy of these third parties to learn how your privacy is protected.</p>

    We may transfer your Personal Information to recipients in other countries. Humble Bundle participates in the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.

<p>Because of the international nature of our business, we may need to transfer your User Information within the Humble Bundle group of companies, and to third parties as noted in Section 9 above, in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy. For this reason, we may transfer your User Information to other countries that may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements to those that apply in the country in which you are located.</p>

<p>Humble Bundle, Inc. participates in and has certified its compliance with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Humble Bundle is committed to subjecting all Personal Information received from European Union (E.U.) member countries and Switzerland, in reliance on the Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework's applicable principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list" target="_blank">Privacy Shield List</a>. Humble Bundle is responsible for the processing of Personal Information it receives under the Privacy Shield Framework and subsequent transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Humble Bundle complies with the Privacy Shield principles for all onward transfers of Personal Information from the E.U. and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. With respect to Personal Information received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Humble Bundle is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Humble Bundle may be required to disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.  If you are a European individual with a privacy related complaint, concern or question about Ziff Davis' privacy practices, please contact us through our <a href="https://dsar.humblebundle.com" target="_blank">DSAR Portal</a> and we will respond within a reasonable time after receiving your request.

You may request a copy of the relevant standard contractual clauses by using our <a href="https://dsar.humblebundle.com" target="_blank">DSAR Portal</a>.</p>

    <p>You can directly take steps to change your preferences for newsletters and online behavioral advertising as outlined in this section.</p>
    <p>If you are an EU resident, you may have certain rights including: the right not to provide your Personal Information to us; the right of access to your Personal Information; the right to request rectification of inaccuracies; the right to request the erasure, or restriction of Processing, of your Personal Information; the right to object to the Processing of your Personal Information; the right to have your Personal Information transferred to another controller; the right to withdraw consent; and the right to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities. We may require proof of or need to verify your identity before we can give effect to these rights.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>You may directly take steps to change your preferences as follows:</p>
<p><em>Access to Your Personal Information.</em> Upon request Humble Bundle will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by logging into your account or contacting us through our <a href="https://dsar.humblebundle.com/" target="_blank">DSAR Portal</a>.  We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
</p>

<p><em>Your Newsletter and Email Subscriptions.</em> You can opt out or unsubscribe to a newsletter or other email list at any time by following the instructions at the end of the newsletters or emails you receive. Please allow five to ten business days for changes to take effect. On some parts of the Service, member service-related communications are an integral part of such Services to which you subscribe and you may continue to receive emails as part of that particular portion of the Services unless you cancel your account, even if you opt out of the newsletters or email list.  If you have provided more than one email address to us, you may continue to be contacted unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided.</p>

<p><em>Push Notifications.</em> We send you push notifications from time-to-time in order to update you about any events or promotions that we may be running. If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device.  Please note that your opt out is limited to the device used and will not affect subsequent subscriptions or non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, transactions, servicing or Humble Bundle's ongoing business relations.</p>

<p><em>Mobile Applications.</em> There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as "Ad IDs" to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps. You can stop all collection of information via our mobile applications by uninstalling them. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device (which is usually located in the Settings area of your device).</p>

<p><em>Unlinking your Humble Bundle Account from Third Party Services.</em>  If you have linked your Humble Bundle account with certain third party services, such as Steam, Twitch, or Battle.net, you may unlink your accounts at any time by visiting your Humble Bundle account settings. Please note that unlinking your accounts will not affect any information previously shared through the linking, and Humble Bundle may continue to use and share that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Humble Bundle is not responsible for any third party data practices, and we recommend that you carefully review their online policies. Steam (which is owned and operated by Valve Corporation) has a privacy policy available <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>OBA.</em>  European Union and Swiss residents should visit the European DAA by <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank">clicking here</a>.  Canadian residents should visit the DAA of Canada by <a href="http://youradchoices.ca/choices" target="_blank">clicking here</a>. U.S. residents and residents of all other countries or territories not listed above can <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" target="_blank">click here</a> for the DAA site to learn more about the use of cookies, your opt-out choices, and more.  For information about the DAA's opt out program for mobile apps, <a href="http://youradchoices.com/appchoices" target="_blank">click here</a>. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of interest-based advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Humble Bundle is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</p>

<p><em>Cookies and Pixel Tags.</em> You may stop or restrict cookies and pixel tags on your computer or purge cookies from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences. However, if you "turn off," purge, or disable cookies or pixel tags, although you may still use the Services, you may not be able to use all of the features, functions, or services available on the Services.</p>

<p><em>California Residents.</em> In accordance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act, we may collect Personal Information about your online activities when you use the Services. While we give our users many avenues to opt out of providing Personal Information, we do not respond to Web browsers' "do not track" signals. California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, permits our users who are California residents to periodically request and obtain certain information about any Personal Information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to make such a request or if you wish for us to refrain from gathering your Personal Information, please submit your request in writing to the contact details set out in Section 17 below.</p>

<p><em>EU Residents.</em> GDPR provides certain rights for EU residents. You may decline to share certain information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide some of the features and functionality of the Services. These rights include, in accordance with applicable law, the right to object to or request the restriction of processing of your information, and to request access to, rectification, erasure and portability of your own information. Where we process your information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent (noting that such withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any Processing performed prior to the date on which we receive notice of such withdrawal, and does not prevent the Processing of your Personal Information in reliance upon any other available legal bases).  Requests should be submitted by contacting us using the <a href="https://dsar.humblebundle.com" target="_blank">DSAR Portal</a>. If you are an EU resident and have any unresolved privacy concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily after contacting us, you have the right to contact the appropriate EU Supervisory Authority and lodge a complaint.</p>
