<p><i>Last Updated: January 1, 2020</i></p>
<p>Thank you for visiting the McGraw Hill Privacy Center. The McGraw Hill Privacy Office is tasked with ensuring the appropriate collection, use, sharing, and handling of your personally identifiable information and personal data (collectively "PII"). At McGraw Hill, we take the privacy and security of PII seriously. We've created this Privacy Center in order to offer you the details you require around the PII we collect about you, no matter what your relationship is with us.</p>
<p>McGraw Hill's products are intended for the use by and in conjunction with parents, educators and students. Since this includes students in the K–12 range, and due to the increasing focus on the security and protection of personal and student information, McGraw Hill is committed to complying with regulations applicable to the collection and use of the PII of minors, such as COPPA and FERPA. Additionally, McGraw Hill recognizes and acknowledges current data protection laws in the European Union (General Data Protection Regulation), Switzerland, and around the world.</p></div>

<ol type="a">
<li>The request complies with all laws and clearly establishes the legal need for disclosure.</li>

<li>Whenever legally permissible, users shall receive notice that their information is being requested.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<h4>What privacy controls and choices do we offer you?</h4>
<p><strong>You have the rights to access, export, be informed about, rectify, object to the further processing of, restrict the processing of, and withdraw consent to the processing of, and erase your PII.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Access and rectification: We strive to ensure that information we have about you is accurate and current. You may obtain confirmation as to whether or not PII concerning you exists, regardless of whether PII has already been recorded, and to be communicated such information in a readily understandable form. If you want to review the PII you have provided to us, or believe that the information we have about you is inaccurate, you should make a request by following the instructions below.</li>
<li>Choice &amp; Objection to processing: With limited exceptions, you may choose to change how we use your PII at any time by following the instructions below on making a request. However, if the PII is required in order to provide you with the service or process a transaction, you may not be able to opt-out without canceling the transaction or service. You may object, in whole or in part, on legitimate grounds, to the processing of your PII, even where such processing is relevant to the purpose of the collection. In addition, you may choose whether to share information about yourself and the use of our sites with third parties such as social media sites. You can also choose whether to receive marketing messages from us (see your options in our “Do we use your PII to market to you?” section above) and you may object, in whole or in part, to such processing.</li>
<li>Restriction of processing: In specific cases (e.g., if you challenge the accuracy of the PII, while this is being checked), you can request a restriction on the processing of your PII, which can only be processed to file or defend claims.</li>
<li>Information: You may be informed a) of the source of the PII; b) of the purposes and methods of the processing; c) of the logic applied to the processing, if processing is carried out with the help of electronic means; d) of the identity of the data controller and data processors; and e) of the entities or categories of entities to whom the PII may be communicated and who may have access to such PII in their capacity as data processor(s) or person(s) in charge of the processing.</li>
<li>Data portability: You may request that we export your PII from our systems in a readily accessible file type. If completed, this means you will have received a copy of your PII that we have retained as a result of you doing business with McGraw Hill.</li>
<li>Withdraw consent: Where we are using your PII with your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time, though this will not affect the lawfulness of our uses of your PII prior to the withdrawal. </li>
<li>Erasure: You may request erasure, anonymization or blocking of PII that have been processed unlawfully, including PII whose retention is unnecessary for the purposes for which it has been collected or subsequently processed, and will obtain certification to the effect that such operations, as well as their contents, have been notified to the entities to whom the data were communicated, unless this requirement proves impossible or involves a manifestly disproportionate effort. At your request, in such instances, we may therefore delete or de-identify your information. However, you should be aware that doing this may limit your use of our services. For example, if you request the deletion of your account within an ecommerce portal, you may be required to re-enter this information should you wish to make another purchase.</li>

<hr>
<h4>What PII do we collect?</h4>
<p><strong>We collect PII, such as contact information and education details, in order to provide you with the product and/or service requested.</strong></p>
<p>We only collect the information required to provide, maintain and improve the digital learning solution you use. When you register, or are registered within one of our digital learning solutions, we collect your name, school, instructor, class, and login information. Once you begin using one of our solutions, we collect your input to questions, technical specifications, and other information about how you use the solution.

<p>Our commitment to privacy and innovation goes beyond compliance, it is part of our culture:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have implemented policies and procedures to support customers in their compliance with privacy laws, including: GDPR, COPPA, and FERPA.</li>

</ul>
<p>By increasing awareness and transparency, we hope to better understand the concerns and learn how to talk with each other about privacy, security, and confidentiality.</p>
<p>Educational institutions, as data controllers, are ultimately responsible for providing a full understanding of the privacy practices around how their students' personally identifiable information is collected, shared, and used. To obtain more detailed information about how data is collected, used, and shared by an educational institution, please contact the appropriate representative at that institution. </p>
