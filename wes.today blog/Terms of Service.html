<p>This website, <a href="https://wes.today">wes.today</a>, does not track you in any way, shape, or form. I don’t care if anyone reads this, or what you click on while you’re reading it.</p>

<p>I do not use tracking.</p>

<p>I do not use analytics.</p>

<p>I do not use any javascript.</p>

<p>I don’t sell any of the data I have, because I don’t have any.</p>

<p>Currently this blog is hosted on Gitlab Pages. Gitlab’s privacy policy is located <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/privacy/">here</a>. Eventually I’ll probably self-host, but until then, this site will remain here.</p>
