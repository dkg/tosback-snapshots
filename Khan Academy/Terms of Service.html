A Child User may use the Services if registered through certain educational organizations or, in certain cases, by School Personnel that have entered into a relationship directly with Khan Academy, so long as the education organization has obtained parent or guardian consent, or has complied with an exemption to parent consent requirements under applicable law. A Child User will only be permitted to use the Services for so long as Khan Academy reasonably believes that such access has been consented to by the Child User&#x27;s parent or guardian, or by School Consent (as discussed in Section 1.6, &quot;School Use&quot;).</li><li>1.5<!-- --> <span class="tos-underline">Parent User</span>.

IF YOU REGISTER, APPROVE OR CONSENT TO THE REGISTRATION OF, OR OTHERWISE ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CHILD USER, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE SUCH CHILD USER&#x27;S LEGAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN AND YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS ON BEHALF OF SUCH CHILD USER, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION BEING LIABLE FOR ALL USE OF THE WEBSITE BY THE CHILD USER.

Khan Academy reserves all rights to take legal actions against anyone who misrepresents personal information or is otherwise untruthful about their identity. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT KHAN ACADEMY CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY ANY USER AND KHAN ACADEMY IS NOT OBLIGATED TO VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF ANY USER, INCLUDING ANY USER&#x27;S CLAIM TO BE A PARENT USER, OR TO VERIFY THAT A PARENT IDENTIFIED BY A CHILD USER OR OTHER PARTY DURING REGISTRATION IS SUCH CHILD USER&#x27;S ACTUAL PARENT OR GUARDIAN.

You and/or the Institution assume sole responsibility for obtaining any consents required from parents or guardians, and for providing appropriate disclosures to School Users and their parents regarding the School Users&#x27; use of the Services, our Terms, and our Privacy Policy. You agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of the School User, for so long as the School User account is not transferred to or assumed by a valid Parent User account or personal account for a Student of eligible age. IF YOU ARE SCHOOL PERSONNEL AND YOU REGISTER AN ACCOUNT FOR A CHILD USER OR OTHER STUDENT (EITHER, A &quot;<b>SCHOOL USER</b>&quot;) OR DIRECT A SCHOOL USER TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT FOR SCHOOL USE, YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE EITHER RECEIVED EXPRESS CONSENT FROM SUCH SCHOOL USER&#x27;S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN OR THAT YOU (OR YOUR INSTITUTION) HAVE COMPLIED AND WILL COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS OF AN EXEMPTION FROM OR EXCEPTION TO PARENTAL CONSENT REQUIREMENTS, NECESSARY FOR YOU TO REGISTER THE SCHOOL USER FOR THE WEBSITE AND PROVIDE TO KHAN ACADEMY THE INFORMATION YOU DISCLOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE REGISTRATION OF SUCH SCHOOL USER.

You represent and warrant to Khan Academy that, prior to creation of accounts for School Use, you have either obtained all necessary parent or guardian consents, or have complied and will comply with all applicable requirements of an exemption from or exception to parental consent requirements, including:<ol class="_6q7mhy"><li>under FERPA, you have complied and will comply with the &quot;school official&quot; exception, or the &quot;directory information&quot; exception thereunder; and</li><li>under COPPA, with respect to Students under the age of 13, you are acting as the agent of the parent and consenting on their behalf to the sharing of the Student&#x27;s personal information.</li></ol></li></ol>We refer to this a &quot;School Consent&quot;. If a Parent User does not consent or rescinds such School Consent, School Personnel or the Institution shall immediately notify Khan Academy to discontinue that Student&#x27;s access to the Services and ensure that such Student&#x27;s information is no longer accessible through the Services. Under no circumstances will Khan Academy be liable for the School Personnel&#x27;s failure to consult their school&#x27;s authorities and administrators or for failing to obtain School Consent when required.</li><li>(c)<!-- --> <span class="tos-underline">Identification of School Accounts</span>. Students and School Personnel may have personal accounts, in addition to accounts established for use in the classroom and associated with the Institution&#x27;s use of the Services (&quot;<b>School Accounts</b>&quot;). If the Institution has a separate written service agreement with Khan Academy that includes rostering services for your Institution, accounts provided for classroom use will be School Accounts. In other cases, in order for accounts established for use in the classroom to be designated as &quot;School Accounts,&quot; the accounts must be (1) created by School Personnel (for example, when a teacher creates the user name, login and password to establish School Accounts, or when the teacher rosters a class using Google Classroom, Clever, or similar Integrated Service (to the extent we support use of such Integrated Service)), or (2) created by a School User at the direction of a School, in each case, using a School email address and associated with a School&#x27;s class on the Service. User accounts created with a personal email address will not be considered School Accounts, and will be administered as personal accounts. If you have questions about how to create School Accounts that are associated with a School&#x27;s class on the Service, please contact our customer support team at<!-- --> <a href="http://khan.co/KA-support">khan.co/KA-support</a>.</li><li>(d)<!-- --> <span class="tos-underline">Use of Integrated Services in School Accounts</span>. If you are School Personnel and you choose to allow your students to log in on the Services using an Integrated Service, such as Google Classroom or Clever (to the extent we support use of such Integrated Service), you are responsible for educating your students on the proper use of Integrated Services and protecting their accounts. See Section 1.3.</li></ol></li><li>1.7<!-- --> <span class="tos-underline">Coaches</span>. Khan Academy may make available certain features and tools that allow Users to add &quot;Coaches&quot; to their account.<ol><li>(a) Coaching features are provided to allow any User to give another User, such as a tutor, friend or family member, the ability to view the activity in their Khan Academy account in order to provide them with tutoring or coaching help on Khan Academy. In these Terms, we refer to any User that you connect to your Khan Academy account (other than School Personnel and Parent Users, who have different account permissions) as a &quot;<b>Coach</b>&quot;. A Parent User associated with a Child User can disable the coaching feature upon account creation, or in the Child&#x27;s User&#x27;s account settings.</li><li>(b) If you are a Coach, the following provisions apply to you. You may use Khan Academy features and tools only for purposes of providing tutoring, coaching or other education-related assistance to a User that has an account established and existing pursuant to these Terms. COACHES ARE NOT PERMITTED TO CREATE OR REGISTER ACCOUNTS FOR ANY OTHER USER. In order to begin coaching relationship, the student or other User you wish to coach must either have a pre-existing account on the Services, or must establish an account pursuant to these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT REGISTRATION OF AN ACCOUNT BY OR FOR A CHILD USER REQUIRES CONSENT FROM SUCH USER&#x27;S PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN. COACHES MAY NOT PROVIDE THIS CONSENT DIRECTLY OR ON BEHALF OF THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN. You must use the Services and the Website in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.</li></ol></li><li>1.8<!-- --> <span class="tos-underline">Linked Accounts</span>. Khan Academy may permit a User to associate a personal account with their School Account, by using the login credentials associated with a personal account to join a class or use the account for school-directed learning. If a User chooses to associate a personal account with their School Account, the two accounts will be deemed &quot;Linked&quot; Accounts, and the User&#x27;s learning activity (information regarding use of the Website generated by the User through use of the Website), whether generated during or outside of the school use, may be viewed by any person with access to either account. &quot;Linked&quot; Accounts are not separately functioning accounts; they permit access to a singular Khan Academy account using more than one account interface or set of access credentials. Linked Accounts may benefit Students who want to use the Website for both personal and school purposes, by allowing School Personnel to have a deeper understanding of Student progress, and by allowing Users to keep track of all of their Khan Academy learning activity on an aggregate basis. The User&#x27;s election to enable account linking must be made, if at all, in connection with the initial account registration and rostering process for a given school year. Once accounts are linked, they cannot be separated. Khan Academy may (but is not required to) enable linking of accounts as described herein. Upon any termination of the School Account by authorized School Personnel, the User&#x27;s learning activity (including any learning activity from school use) will be retained in any Linked personal account.</li><li>1.9<!-- --> <span class="tos-underline">School Districts</span>. Khan Academy may enter into supplemental written agreements with school districts with respect to use of the Services on a district-wide basis (&quot;<b>District Agreements</b>&quot;).

If Khan Academy is notified as required, then the School Accounts held by that Institution will remain governed by the Terms in effect immediately prior to the change until the end of the end of the then current term of the Institution&#x27;s written service agreement with Khan Academy, or, in the absence of such an agreement, the end of the current school term.

Any Dispute which has not been resolved by negotiation as provided herein within sixty (60) days or such time period as you and Khan Academy may otherwise agree, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described in this Section 15.4. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act.

You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS Rules. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. To the extent the forum provided by JAMS is unavailable, Khan Academy and you agree to select a mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution service and that such alternative dispute resolution service shall apply the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief to you only individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</li><li>(f)<!-- --> <span class="tos-italics">Arbitration Fees</span>. Whoever files the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee.

Each party will bear the expense of that party&#x27;s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.</li><li>(g)<!-- --> <span class="tos-italics">Filing Period</span>. To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under these Terms must be filed within one (1) year in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins when the events giving rise to the Dispute first occur.

In the event that any Dispute cannot be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 15.4, you agree that such Dispute will be filed only in the state or federal courts in and for Santa Clara County, California, and each of you and Khan Academy hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such action.
