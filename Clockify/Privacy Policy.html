I used to under invoice for my time and lose income but now I can bill for every second I work on his projects. Also, it has great reporting function and can either print off or save as a PDF or Excel etc. So not only do I invoice my client, I've also got exact data for the time I carry out each of his tasks.",

    <h2 id="privacy-1" class="terms__sub_header">1. DEFINITIONS</h2>
    <p class="terms__text">When we say <b>"you"</b>, <b>"your"</b> or <b>"Data Subject"</b> we mean any natural person that shares personal data with us via Website.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">When we say <b>"processing"</b> we mean any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or sets of personal data. This includes activities such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">When we say <b>"personal data"</b> or <b>"data"</b> we mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person; an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, either directly or indirectly. Therefore, data about a company or any legal entity is not considered to be personal data but registering on behalf of a legal entity may include sharing personal data. For example, the information in relation to one-person companies may constitute personal data where it allows the identification of a natural person. The rules also apply to all personal data relating to natural persons in the course of professional activity, such as the employees of a company or organization, business e-mail addresses like <b>"firstname.surname@company.com"</b>. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information from which no individual can reasonably be identified (anonymized information).</p>
    <p class="terms__text">When we say <b>"Data Processors"</b> or <b>"processor"</b> we mean any natural or legal person who processes the data on behalf of the Data Controller. In some cases, COING is a Data Processor and in others, Data Controller (as further explained in Section 2). In addition, we may use the services of various service providers to process your data more effectively. In such cases, they are either our processors or sub-processors.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">When we say <b>"cookies"</b> we mean small pieces of data stored on your device (computer or mobile device). This information is used to track your use of the Website and to compile statistical reports on website activity. For further information about the use of cookies and how you can manage them, please read our <a href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">When we say <b>"consent"</b> we mean your explicit consent on the processing of personal data. Persons who are 15 years of age or older may give free consent to the processing of their personal data.</p>
    <h2 id="privacy-2" class="terms__sub_header">2. DATA CONTROLLER OR DATA PROCESSOR</h2>
    <p class="terms__text">In relation to your personal data processed on or via the Website, COING may be either a Data Controller or Data Processor.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">When COING acts in the capacity of a Data Controller, COING determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data. The purpose of data processing is the reason why we process your personal data. The table in Section 4 of the Privacy Policy presents the purposes and legal basis for data processing. In such cases, COING is responsible for your personal data.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">This Privacy Policy contains information on processing your data in the capacity of a Data Controller. Should you have any inquiries, or you wish to exercise any of the rights of a Data Subject stipulated in Section 10, please contact us:</p>

    <p class="terms__text">By using the Service, you may disclose, share, record, or otherwise use various types of data via a Workspace as the User Content. The type of User Content is determined by the person that owns the Workspace and not by us. In that event, COING is a Data Processor and Data Controller is the owner of the Workspace. Thus, COING does not analyze, disclose or access such date unless a User sends a request for support and, in these cases, the access is limited to enabling the functioning of the Service. Should you wish to send an inquiry or exercise any of the Data Subject's rights, please contact the owner of the relevant Workspace via which your personal data has been processed.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">Please also note that we do not collect your personal data if you are End User of Server Clockify. In that case, Client (the company that has Clockify installed on their server) is responsible for your personal data.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">If you represent a User that falls under the scope of application of the GDPR, you will need to sign the Data Protection Addendum to these Terms of Use (<b>"DPA"</b>), with COING as a Data Processor based outside the EEA. The DPA includes the Standard Contractual Clauses adopted by the European Commission, as applicable, and reflects the Parties' agreement with respect to the terms governing the processing of personal data under the CLOCKIFY's <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>. Signing the DPA will be considered as an amendment to the Agreement (within the meaning of Section 1 of the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>) and will be considered to form a part of the Agreement.</p>

    <p class="terms__text">We have strict due diligence procedures and measures in place and review, assess and background check all processors prior to forming a business relationship. We obtain company documents, certifications, references and ensure that the processor is adequate, appropriate and effective for the task we are employing them for.</p>

    <p class="terms__text">We may transfer your personal data to countries other than the one you reside in. Given that we follow internal rules for the protection of personal data that are stricter than the applicable law (see Section 22 of the <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>), in these cases, we transfer your personal data only:</p>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="privacy-9" class="terms__sub_header">9. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR DATA?</h2>
    <p class="terms__text">The period for which we store your personal data depends on a particular purpose for the processing of personal data, as explained in detail in Section 4. We retain personal data for as long as we reasonably require it for legal or business purposes. In determining data retention periods, we take into consideration the applicable law (see Section 22 of the Terms of Use), contractual obligations, and the expectations and requirements of our Users. When we no longer need personal information, or when you request us to delete your information, where this is legal, we will securely delete or destroy it.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">However, as an exception to the retention periods in Section 4 the data may be processed to determine, pursue or defend claims and counterclaims.</p>
    <h2 id="privacy-10" class="terms__sub_header">10. YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
    <p class="terms__text">Given that transparency is one of our cornerstone principles, we grant Data Subjects certain rights in relation to their personal data. These rights may be exercised by Data Subject when COING operates as a Data Controller. If your inquiry or exercise of any of the Data Subject's rights relates to the data on a Workspace, please contact the owner of the relevant Workspace via which your personal data has been processed.</p>
    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">Right of Access</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">You can send us a request for a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">We have ensured that appropriate measures have been taken to provide such in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Such information is provided in writing free of charge. It may be provided by other means when authorized by the Data Subject and with prior verification as to the subject's identity.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">Information is provided to the Data Subject at the earliest convenience, but at a maximum of 30 days from the date the request was received. Where the retrieval or provision of information is particularly complex or is subject to a valid delay, the period may be extended by two further months where necessary.</p>
    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">Right to Correction of Your Personal Data</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">If the personal data we have about you is incorrect, you have the right to request that we correct those data. Where notified of inaccurate data by the Data Subject, we will rectify the error within 30 days and inform any third party of the rectification if we have disclosed the personal data in question to them.</p>
    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">Right to Erasure</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">You have the right to request from us that your personal data is deleted in certain circumstances including:</p>
    <ul class="terms__list">
      <li>&mdash; The personal data are no longer needed for the purpose for which they were collected;</li>
      <li>&mdash; You withdraw your consent (where the processing was based on consent);</li>
      <li>&mdash; You object to the processing and no overriding legitimate grounds are justifying us processing the personal data;</li>
      <li>&mdash; The personal data have been unlawfully processed; or</li>
      <li>&mdash; To comply with a legal obligation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="terms__text">However, this right does not apply where, for example, the processing is necessary:</p>
    <ul class="terms__list">
      <li>&mdash; To comply with a legal obligation; or</li>
      <li>&mdash; For the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">If the accuracy of the personal data is contested, you consider the processing is unlawful but you do not want it erased, we no longer need the personal data but you require it for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or you have objected to the processing and verification, you can exercise your right to the restriction of processing.</p>
    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">Right to Data Portability</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">Where you have provided personal data to us, you have the right to receive such personal data back in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and to have those data transmitted to a third-party Data Controller without hindrance but in each case only where:</p>
    <ul class="terms__list">
      <li>&mdash; The processing is carried out by automated means; and</li>
      <li>&mdash; The processing is based on your consent or the performance of a contract with you.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">Right to Withdraw the Consent</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">If you have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal data, you have the right to fully or partly withdraw your consent. Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose(s) to which you originally consented unless there is another legal ground for the processing.</p>
    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">Right to Lodge a Complaint</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">If you have any concerns or requests in relation to your personal data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@clockify.me">support@clockify.me</a> and we will respond as soon as possible but not later than within 30 days.</p>
    <h2 id="privacy-11" class="terms__sub_header">11. CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
    <p class="terms__text">We reserve the right to change Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole discretion. If we make any changes, we will publish the new rules on this web page and, if we have your e-mail, we will notify you directly.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">Where you have previously consented to our Privacy Policy, your continued use of the Website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of the updated rules.</p>
