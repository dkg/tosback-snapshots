I used to under invoice for my time and lose income but now I can bill for every second I work on his projects. Also, it has great reporting function and can either print off or save as a PDF or Excel etc. So not only do I invoice my client, I've also got exact data for the time I carry out each of his tasks.",

COING may also access the User Content when providing technical support or when performing other legal obligations under this Agreement.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">Nevertheless, COING has no obligation to monitor User Content (and will make no attempt to do so) and has no obligation to remove any User Content.</p>

    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">13.2 RISK OF EXPOSURE</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">The User recognizes and agrees that providing and using cloud-based services involves risks of unauthorized disclosure or exposure and by accessing and using the Software, the User assumes such risks. COING offers no representation, warranty, or guarantee that User Data (as defined in Section 13.4) will not be exposed or disclosed through errors or the unlawful actions of third parties.</p>
    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">13.3 DATA ACCURACY</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">COING will have no responsibility or liability for the accuracy of data uploaded to the Software by User, including without limitation User Data (as defined in Section 13.4) and any other data uploaded by Users.</p>
    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">13.4 USE OF THE USER DATA</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">For the purpose of TOU, "User Data" shall mean data in electronic form input or collected through the Software or Service by or from any User (in the broadest possible interpretation of the term), including without limitation personal data (as defined in <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>).</p>
    <p class="terms__text">Unless it receives User's prior written consent, COING: </p>
    <p class="terms__text">(a) shall not access, process, or otherwise use User Data other than as necessary to provide the Service and use of Software or as stipulated in DPA (as defined in <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>); </p>

COING shall give the User prompt notice of any such legal or governmental demand and reasonably cooperate with the User in any effort to seek a protective order or otherwise to contest such required disclosure, at the User's expense. As between the Parties, the User retains ownership of User Data. </p>
    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">13.5 COMPLIANCE WITH DATA PROTECTION LAWS</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">Providing the Service by COING involves processing the User's personal data (as defined in <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>) including the processing of personal data of Users who have been invited or enabled to use Clockify by an Enterprise. The purposes and means of processing are determined by the User (including the Enterprise) and not by COING, making the User or Enterprise the data controller. By providing the Service COING acts as a data processor and processes personal data on behalf of and according to instructions given by the User or Enterprise. Despite all other provisions of the Agreement, it is in the User's or Enterprise's full responsibility, according to the all applicable privacy legislation, to ensure the legal grounds for processing the personal data as defined in <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>), as well as to properly assess the proportionality of the personal data processing. By signing or consenting to the TOU, the User or Enterprise warrants and grants to COING that the User or Enterprise has secured a valid purpose and legal basis to process personal data via the Service. The User (including the Enterprise) warrants and grants that it has informed the data subjects on all aspects of the processing via the Service or the Software before processing has started and has enforced proper policies and/or has undertaken necessary steps if stipulated by the applicable data protection legislation (such as, for example, undertaking DPIA). </p>
    <p class="terms__text">A USER OR AN ENTERPRISE MAY USE DIFFERENT CLOCKIFY FEATURES. SOME FEATURES MAY PROVE TO BE MORE INTRUSIVE TO PRIVACY THAN OTHERS (for example, <a href="/help/extra-features/gps-tracking">GPS tracking</a> or <a href="/help/extra-features/screenshots">Screenshots</a>). BEFORE ACTIVATING A CERTAIN FEATURE THE USER OR ENTERPRISE MUST MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE FEATURE OPERATES (including but not limited to how COING may process personal data on behalf of the User or Enterprise). </p>
    <p class="terms__text">COING STRONGLY SUGGEST THE USE OF SUCH FEATURES ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY WHEN THE USER OR AN ENTERPRISE, AS A CONTROLLER, CAN SECURE LAWFUL PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA UNDER THE APPLICABLE PRIVACY LEGISLATION. IN ALL OTHER CASES, COING STRONGLY SUGGEST TO USERS AND ENTERPRISES TO REFRAIN FROM THE USE OF THOSE FEATURES. </p>
    <p class="terms__text">Each User and Enterprise understand and accepts that Clockify functionalities are not meant to be used for the processing of any special categories of personal data ((including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or biometric data, health data, sex life or sexual orientation). </p>
    <p class="terms__text">The User or Enterprise shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless COING in full and on-demand from and against any and all liabilities, claims, demands, damages, losses or expenses (including legal and other professional adviser's fees and disbursements), interest and penalties incurred by COING arising out of or in connection with the User's or Enterprise's breach of the obligations stipulated in this paragraph.</p>
    <h3 class="terms__sub_header__h3">13.6 CONSEQUENCES OF THE ILLEGAL USER CONTENT</h3>
    <p class="terms__text">In the event COING becomes aware of the illegal User Content, activities that infringe anyone's Intellectual Property Rights or personal data or any other right, or activities that infringe these Terms of Use, COING may, in its sole discretion, disable, close, temporarily or permanently limit access to any User Account without any notice. COING may not be liable for any loss, damages or undesirable consequences resulting from such action.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">COING may permanently erase User Data if the User Account is delinquent, suspended, or terminated for 30 (thirty) days or more.</p>

    <p class="terms__text">You agree that this limitation of liability represents a reasonable allocation of risk and is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between COING and you. You understand that the Website, Service and Software would not be provided without such limitations.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">Some countries do not allow the limitation of certain damages, so some or all of this limitation of liability may not apply to you and you may have additional rights. Nevertheless, if any portion of these sections is held to be invalid under the applicable law, the invalidity of such portion shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the applicable sections.</p>
    <p class="terms__text">Section 15 does not exclude mandatory liability for:</p>
